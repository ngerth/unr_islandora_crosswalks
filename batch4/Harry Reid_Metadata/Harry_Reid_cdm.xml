    <title>Photograph of Harry Reid with John Herrington, Nevada, 1986</title>
    <description>Senator-Elect Harry Reid, left, shows Department of Energy Secretary John Herrington his anti-repository letter to the President. The letter, initiated in July, opposes the location of a high-level nuclear waste repository in Nevada. Reid told the Secretary that Nevadans are patriotic and support a strong national defense, &quot;but we've done more than our fair share.&quot; More than 33,000 Nevadans have signed the letter, which confirms they are &quot;unalterably opposed to the disposal of any high-level nuclear waste in Nevada, now or in the future, under any circumstances.&quot; As Herrington looks at the letter and a sample of the signatures, Reid stands next to a pile of the signature sheets on his desk. Herrington will now present the letter and signatures to the President.</description>
