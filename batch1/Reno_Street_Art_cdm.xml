    <title>Unknown [Reno is Rad]</title>
    <creator>Lucido, Michael</creator>
    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Michael Lucido's electric-box mural features two sunglass-wearing raccoons on the back. A raccoon holding a video camera in its right hand while flashing a &quot;sign of the horns&quot; gesture (the index finger and the little finger are upright and the thumb is clasped against the two middle fingers) on his left hand sits atop the shoulders of the other raccoon who is performing a kick flip on a sky-blue skateboard with pink wheels, the words &quot;Rad Thief&quot; ( a reference to the name of Lucido's clothing company: Rad Thief) appear on the bottom of the board. The raccoons are painted against a teal, yellow, and pink background. The skateboarding theme of this box possibly relates to its location at City Park Plaza, used in the past as an unofficial skate park. The video camera might be symbolic Lucido's involvement with the multi-media production.</description>

From left to right: Anthony Ortega won the competition with a psychedelic mural composition that combines ancient Mesoamerican art with futuristic elements. This mural is painted with vibrant shades of blue, red, green, orange, yellow, pink, and purple, portraying a vivid ancient Mesoamerican god-like figure that emerges from the stellar depths of the galaxy behind it and begins it descent into the green forest that surrounds the outer edges of the mural; Kendel Leslie painted a colorful mural with a blue humpback whale as the primary subject. The whale is painted in several shades of blue and purple. The background is composed of different shapes and formed in light pink, magenta, lime green, pastel yellow and purple among a black background with white stars, alluding to a galaxy-like ocean; Artist Raphael Blanco's mural d</description>

    <contributor>Children's Cabinet; Reno Police Department;</contributor>
    <date>2017;</date>
    <description>The mural on the two adjacent back walls of Mountain Music Parlor was painted by a group of youth who are part of the Children's Cabinet's &quot;Spray Positive&quot; program. This program was instigated by the Reno Police Department, in collaboration with the Children's Cabinet, as a way to beautify blighted properties in Midtown and Downtown Reno. A dream catcher with music notes in the web leads to the head of a Native-American figure wearing an elaborate headdress. An American flag emerges from the left side of the headdress and straddles both walls. A portrait of a man in a cowboy hat (most likely bluegrass musician Bill Monroe) painted in front of the flag graces the adjacent wall, and the mural concludes with a rendering of a chick playing a cello with the name &quot;Bill Monroe&quot; painted above it.</description>

    <description>Kendel Leslie's signal-box mural is dedicated to the preservation of Nevada's wilderness and wildlife. Leslie has painted a public-service announcement on the back side of the box: the words &quot;Do your part, stand up for wildlife&quot; with the outline of a heart at the end and the silhouettes of various animals (bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain bluebird, jackrabbit, and coyote) have been encased in a gray rectangle with curvy edges. A sky with rolling white clouds appears above. Blue, green, and yellow rolling hills appear below. In the bottom-right corner, a jackrabbit stands in the dessert landscape. Leslie's name and Facebook address (Facebook.com/KendelsArt) are painted in black in the bottom-right corner.</description>

    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock depicts a cowboy riding a wild mustang into the sunset, representative of the Reno Rodeo, in this mural painted during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October, 2017. A halo of barbed wire floats above the cowboy's hat and a locomotive disguises itself in the body of the mustang. The background is painted bright blue with a beige banner swirling across it that reads &quot;Get Buck Get Broke.&quot; Objects, such as grape bundles, crowns (a common object in Rock's murals), hearts and cherries speckle the mural's background.</description>

    <contributor>Blum Reno</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits, spanning the entire 250 x 20 foot mural. The portraits, from left to right, are as follows: Frederic DeLongchamps, one of Nevada's most prolific architects; Dot So La Lee, a basket weaver and member of the northwestern Nevada Washoe; Wovoka, a Paiute religious leader; Ben Palmer, one of the original settlers of and most successful ranchers in the Carson Valley; Michael Heizer, a contemporary artist whose life-long project, City, is &quot;the largest piece of contemporary art ever attempted&quot; (http://doublenegative.tarasen.net/city/)&quot;; Jeanne Wier, founder of the Nevada Historical Society; Abraham Lincoln, whose re-election in 1864 was largely due to Nevada's expedited entry into statehood; Jack Johnson, who, after winning a bout against James Jeffries in Reno, NV in 1910, became the first African American world heavyweight boxing champion; Sarah Winnemucca, a Northern Paiute activist from Nevada; and Mark Twain, who lived and wrote for a newspaper in Virginia City and Carson City, NV in the early 1860s. Each portrait contains a detail pertaining to the individual, for example: buildings on top of DeLonghamps' head; a basket behind the top of Dot So La Lee's head; a brand surrounded by barbed wire on top of Palmer's head; Heizer wears a hat that appears sculpted from metal to symbolize his work as a sculptor; a rendering of the Nevada Historical Society in the broach pinned to Weir's collar; the US Highway sign imposed on Lincoln's head is symbolic of his namesake, US Route 40; a rendering of Johnson knocking Jeffries out during the championship bout; and the top of Twain's head represented as an open book, and a quill pen over his right shoulder. </description>

    <description>A woman and young boy dance together in this mural by Erik Burke. Their bodies and garments are painted using the same palette of browns, reds, and greens. The boy wears a long-sleeved shirt with teal stripes around the forearms, upper arms and chest, matching the string of pearls worn by the woman. Two bright green-flanked-by-white stripes run through the mural, a curved one along the top and a straight one along the bottom. Starting near the left elbow of the boy, bright pink flowers interspersed with black dots run around and then through the dancers. A raven appears on the left side of the mural, perched atop the building's awning. The mural is 26 x 60 ft.</description>

    <contributor>Ponderosa Meat &amp; Provision Co.</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Ponderous, painted by Erik Burke on a metal meat freezer at Ponderosa Meat &amp; Provision Co., features a portrait of John Muir on the left in front of snow-covered mountains and a body of water, flanked by an open hand about to receive a pine cone, with white and gray stripes running through the scene. Burke used a simple color palette consisting of white, black, grays and browns. The description of the mural on Burke's website is as follows: &quot;Correlating the etymology of the building's namesake and John Muir, a profound advocate for the preservation and enjoyment of the nearby Sierras. The mural places a pondering and monochromatic Muir in a winter landscape next to a hand catching a falling pinecone as an allegory for the weight of man's relationship with nature. A trinity of lines helps order the various planes and build a stage of depth.&quot; </description>

    <description>This mural depicts a not-so-typical day at the beach. A woman, half human and half mermaid, with the words &quot;Mer-Maid in the Shade&quot; painted along her tail, suns herself on a beach populated by beach balls, towels, umbrellas and other beach goers, such as the two children building a sand castle. Above the beach is a crumbling-city skyline caused by the lashing tail of the spotted sea creature that swims in the ocean below. An orca emerges from the water above the words &quot;Life's a Beach&quot; and a bright orange sun wearing shutter shades hangs in the sky.</description>

    <date>2016</date>
    <description>This painted-wall sign welcomes those driving past it to Dickerson Road, an area west of downtown Reno, running parallel to the Truckee River, that is referred to as &quot;'Reno’s Industrial Arts District,' combining art, commercial and residential properties, and a nature preserve.&quot; Using bright and vibrant colors, Eric (Erik) Burke and Buz Rhodes painted large block letters, with orange and red shadows behind them, to spell out &quot;Dickerson,&quot; with imagery and scenes appearing in each letter that signify and represent the nature of the district. The &quot;D&quot; features an angle grinder cutting metal; a paint brush stands in for the &quot;I&quot;; the &quot;C&quot; features the profile of half of a sandwich; the &quot;K&quot; displays a smith forging a piece of metal; the &quot;E&quot; shows someone wearing tan pants and brown boots laying under the hood of a vehicle; the &quot;R&quot; features a woman's body in profile from her lower torso to the top of her knees, wearing a black and white striped undergarment, with red rose vines over the entire image; the &quot;S&quot; contains water with green and purple lily pads floating on top; the &quot;O&quot; is made up of a figure wearing tan garments throwing on a yellow pottery wheel; and the &quot;N&quot; includes a variety of multicolored metal bottle caps. The words &quot;Welcome to&quot; and &quot;Live, Work, Eat, Play&quot; appear in red and blue on a white banner painted on the left side of the mural. The artists' names,&quot;Eric Burke and Buz Rhodes,&quot; appear in red and blue on a white banner painted in the upper far-right corner of the mural. </description>

    <date>2011</date>
    <description>This hardware-themed mural was painted by artist Joe C. Rock on the southern wall of Ace Hardware in Midtown Reno. On the left side of the mural, a can of red paint pours down from the top onto a wooden paint stirrer stick with the Ace logo on it. On the left, a paint brush has been dipped in the red paint and a paint roller above the brush has been rolled in the paint. In the scene on the right side of the mural, a man wearing a white chef's hat and apron is barbecuing or deep frying a turkey in a fenced-in yard surrounded by tall pine trees. Rock has utilized the natural brick facade of the wall to depict the brick patio the man stands on, and the blue sky behind and above him flows into the blue label on the paint can.</description>

    <description>This monochromatic mural set against a light blue background depicts a camera with a roll of film unraveling from its film compartment. On the unraveled film can be seen the undeveloped images that the camera has captured. A girl holds her dog; a man hangs out the driver-side window of a van and looks at the camera; a man kneels in front of his bicycle; two children ride their bicycles; a man looks to his left with a city street behind him; a man holds two bags (one in each hand) up in the air and smiles at the camera; a woman stands with her hands in her pockets and smiles at the camera; a young girl looks quizzically at the camera; a young man looks back at the camera from the driver-side window of his car; a man stands with his hands in his pockets in front of a light pole; a man with a thick mustache looks directly at the camera, a skull-like object is to the left of him; four children sit together on some steps; a young girl rides a rocking horse. The film roll ends, leading into an orange burst and then beam of light that perhaps represents the light needed to expose the film. The light beam is surrounded by black, blue, and gray clouds. </description>

    <description>This mural depicts a trout with vibrantly colored, checkered skin. Among the various patterns in its checkered skin are cherries, PacMan ghosts, chains, peacock feathers, roses, polka dots, and botehs (the teardrop-shaped motif with a curved upper end that comprises the paisley pattern). Below the fish is the message &quot;Lahontan Cutthroat Trout Back From Extinction!&quot; A bee (not visible) hovers behind the trout, holding in its legs a sewing needle through which a piece of pink thread attached to the caudal peduncle of the fish is threaded. To the right of the bee are the words &quot;One Love&quot; and the artist's moniker (Mafat) and date.</description>

    <description>The two roller doors of the Reno Fire Department station in downtown Reno each depict different fire helmets. On the left door is a dark-brown leather helmet with a red leather shield affixed to the front that reads &quot;RFD 1 Engine.&quot; Smoke emerges from behind the helmet. In the lower-left corner of the door is a monochromatic scene depicting three firefighters and a fire engine. On the right third of the door is another monochromatic scene depicting one of two firefighters (or one split in half by the wall between the two doors) fully suited up and wearing a helmet with respirator.</description>

    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock combines United States history with the history of Nevada in this mural that was commissioned to celebrate the Historic Lincoln Highway. Abraham Lincoln appears on the left side of the mural, leading to the Nevada flag and then U.S. flag, over which the words &quot;LINCOLN HIGHWAY&quot; are painted in different font styles and are flanked by the Nevada flag and the Interstate 40 highway sign. All subjects combined, this mural conveys the relevance of this president and his namesake highway. </description>

    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock pays homage to the renowned artist, Georgia O'Keefe, through a surrealist-style head (that of O'Keefe, according to Rock) that explodes with ideas. The mountain on her left shoulder, as well as the hanging flower, refer subjects in O'Keefe's own artworks. Rock adds a twist to the O'Keefe style by incorporating words in different font styles and vibrant colors such as pink, purple, green, and yellow.</description>

    <contributor>Renaissance Reno Downtown Hotel</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>According to artist Joe C. Rock, his mural on the exterior wall of the Renaissance Reno Downtown Hotel &quot;depicts imagery of Reno and the greater-Nevada area. The octagon 'R' is from the second Reno arch that ran from 1963-1987 [and] the background is filled with sage, our state flower. The 'E' is filled with a mountain bluebird, our state bird. The 'N' is inside a silver state of Nevada with a portrait of Jesse Reno, our city's namesake. The 'O' is from the current Reno arch [and sits over] a heart, inside the 'O' is a landscape of Mt. Rose surrounded by a red rose. The piece is finished off with the words 'Home Means Nevada,' our state song&quot; (https://www.instagram.com/p/BUS8FaqDbF4/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=joecrock13).  </description>

    <description>This gold crown-and chain-wearing flamingo, painted by Michael Lucido during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, performs a darkside grind on his light-yellow skateboard, against a bright blue background flanked by black palm trees. The railing against which the grind is performed is wrapped in electricity sparks.</description>

    <date>2014</date>
    <description>This signal box is covered in white birch trees. Artist Clarissa Stephens painted the birches, with their characteristic white bark marked with long, horizontal lenticels (lines), against a background of nearly the same color, using a slightly more gray tone of white and a shading technique to make the birches pop against the white background. A few golden-yellow leaves appear on the tips of some of the birches' branches.</description>

    <creator>Cellier, Stephane;</creator>
    <contributor>Art Spot Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Artist Stephane Cellier used the natural angles of the wall upon which he painted this monochromatic mural during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017 to create an optical illusion. An &quot;x&quot; accompanied by &quot;please stand here to view the mural&quot; is painted on the the ground, marking the &quot;sweet spot&quot; from where the intended depiction of the mural can be correctly and fully observed (essentially from where this photograph was taken): a man receiving a kiss on the cheek from a woman with words above that read &quot;Two Smiles Getting Closer End Up Making...A Kiss.&quot; Viewed head-on, the mural is a distorted mess. </description>

    <creator>Vaka</creator>
    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>A portion of the front end of a red classic car appears on the right side of Vaka's signal-box mural. Yellow and light-purple hand prints adorn the grill of the car and yellow, light-purple and light-blue hand prints appear below the bumper. A black mountainous skyline with &quot;Reno&quot; painted over it in pink is depicted in the car's license. Vaka's moniker is painted on the top of the right side in purple and white. The content and theme of the mural (the classic car and Monroe eating a burger) relates to the location in which the signal box resides: in front of Juicy's Giant Hamburgers, a popular restaurant in Reno with the feel of an old-fashioned burger joint.</description>

    <description>This mural is a three-part piece painted by artist Joe C. Rock. The two fences here (of three total) converge into a nautical star with monochromatic portraits of Jesse Lee Reno to the left and John Sparks to the right. Sage brush grows horizontally from each man's face. On the left (Reno) side of the fence, Nevada's nickname/slogan &quot;Battle Born&quot; is painted in black along the length of the fence, against a rich blue background. A mountain bluebird perches on the sagebrush in front of the &quot;B&quot; in &quot;Born.&quot; The golden-yellow banner from the Nevada state flag wraps around flows through the entire scene. On the far right-end of the right (Sparks) side of the fence is a depiction of the Nevada bicentennial coin. Barbed wire winds around the sagebrush on this side of the fence, and the golden-yellow banner from the Nevada state flag wraps around flows through the entire scene.</description>

    <contributor>Blum Reno</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits, spanning the entire 250 x 20 foot mural. The portraits, from left to right, are as follows: Frederic DeLongchamps, one of Nevada's most prolific architects; Dot So La Lee, a basket weaver and member of the northwestern Nevada Washoe; Wovoka, a Paiute religious leader; Ben Palmer, one of the original settlers of and most successful ranchers in the Carson Valley; Michael Heizer, a contemporary artist whose life-long project, City, is &quot;the largest piece of contemporary art ever attempted&quot; (http://doublenegative.tarasen.net/city/)&quot;; Jeanne Wier, founder of the Nevada Historical Society; Abraham Lincoln, whose re-election in 1864 was largely due to Nevada's expedited entry into statehood; Jack Johnson, who, after winning a bout against James Jeffries in Reno, NV in 1910, became the first African American world heavyweight boxing champion; Sarah Winnemucca, a Northern Paiute activist from Nevada; and Mark Twain, who lived and wrote for a newspaper in Virginia City and Carson City, NV in the early 1860s. Each portrait contains a detail pertaining to the individual, for example: buildings on top of DeLonghamps' head; a basket behind the top of Dot So La Lee's head; a brand surrounded by barbed wire on top of Palmer's head; Heizer wears a hat that appears sculpted from metal to symbolize his work as a sculptor; a rendering of the Nevada Historical Society in the broach pinned to Weir's collar; the US Highway sign imposed on Lincoln's head is symbolic of his namesake, US Route 40; a rendering of Johnson knocking Jeffries out during the championship bout; and the top of Twain's head represented as an open book, and a quill pen over his right shoulder. </description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>This mural painted by artist Joe C. Rock represents the city of Reno, as well as the Statewide Lighting &amp; Accents company (where the mural resides). The center of the mural highlights a large brightly-lit light bulb with a crown (a common object in Rock's paintings) sitting at the top. Behind the light bulb, the city's well-known &quot;Reno&quot; sign hides, acknowledging the brightness of the rising city. The word &quot;BRIGHT&quot; is also woven within the mural behind leaves and orange circles. Underneath the light bulb, the ground from which the bulb rises is visible; the word &quot;IDEAS&quot; is written through a depiction of stones.</description>

    <contributor>Art Spot Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Artist Stephane Cellier used the natural angles of the wall upon which he painted this monochromatic mural during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017 to create an optical illusion. An &quot;x&quot; accompanied by &quot;please stand here to view the mural&quot; is painted on the the ground, marking the &quot;sweet spot&quot; from where the intended depiction of the mural can be correctly and fully observed (essentially from where this photograph was taken): a man receiving a kiss on the cheek from a woman with words above that read &quot;Two Smiles Getting Closer End Up Making...A Kiss.&quot; Viewed head-on, the mural is a distorted mess. </description>

    <creator>Vaka</creator>
    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>A rendering of Marilyn Monroe eating a burger wraps around the left and back side of Vaka's signal-box mural. Monroe wears a pink top and lifts the burger up to her mouth, ready to take a bight. A salt shaker sits in the lower-left corner of the back side of the box. The content and theme of the mural (the classic car and Monroe eating a burger) relates to the location in which the signal box resides: in front of Juicy's Giant Hamburgers, a popular restaurant in Reno with the feel of an old-fashioned burger joint.</description>

    <description>Each side of Bryce Chisholm's signal box portrays a distinct image. On the right side, a little girl wearing a tutu has been painted against a vibrant yellow background using white, black, and blue paint and a stencil (a technique that Chisholm is known for). She casts a purple, water-coloresque shadow on the ground. Two tall buildings and a black human figure either jumping or striking a dance pose, (both also painted using a stencil), appear in the background.</description>

    <description>The left side of this signal box painted by Vaka portrays the lower leg and boot-clad foot of the child riding a sheep on the adjacent back side of the box. Behind the leg and foot, the white body of the sheep can be seen. The background is various shades of brown and is speckled with yellow, purple, red, green and pink hand prints. The theme of this signal box relates to its proximity to the Reno Livestock Events Center, the venue for the Reno Rodeo.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Raccoon Food Truck]</title>
    <creator>Lucido, Michael</creator>
    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Artist Michael Lucido's electric-box mural depicts a food truck driven and manned by raccoons serving skateboards. The raccoon driving the truck wears sunglasses, his mouth is open with his tongue hanging out, his right arm hangs out the open window of the truck, and is raised up in the air with a &quot;sign of the horns&quot; gesture (the index finger and the little finger are upright and the thumb is clasped against the two middle fingers) on his hand. Another sunglass-wearing raccoon with a big-open smile on his face sits on the serving counter of the truck under a brown awning with his right foot resting on the back of a skateboard. His right hand flashes the &quot;shaka&quot; sign, also known as the &quot;hang loose&quot; sign, while he holds a red beverage in his left hand. Behind this raccoon, inside the truck, hang two rows of four vibrantly-colored skateboards. A fire-extinguisher cabinet with the message &quot;In Case of Emergency Event Break Glass&quot; painted on it hangs behind the raccoon that sits on the counter, but instead of containing a fire extinguisher, it contains an aqua-blue skateboard with pink wheels. The truck's license plate reads &quot;RAD THF,&quot; a reference to the name of Lucido's clothing company: Rad Thief. The skateboard-food-truck theme of this box possibly relates to its location at City Park Plaza, used in the past as an unofficial skate park, and to the food-truck culture that has developed in the area over the past several years.</description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Erik Burke painted this mural for Morgan's Lobster Shack and Fish Market, explaining the lobster in the middle of the mural against a background of blue ocean water that transitions to dark and then a lighter gray above, with nine buoys floating at the top of the mural. The buoys are painted a variety of colors (from left to right): white on a black rope; gold on a natural rope; black, yellow, and robin's-egg-blue striped on a black rope; red on a natural rope; pink on a natural rope; teal, white and red on a natural rope; pink on a natural rope; white and dark purple striped on a black rope; and black, white and red striped on a black rope. The lobster has been painted using several shades of orange and black, but the details of and sheen on the lobster was created using a variety of unexpected colors: sky, cerulean and periwinkle blue; yellow; peach; fern and crocodile green; lavender and iris purple; and red. Burke's moniker (OU38) and website (eriktburke.com) are painted in light blue on the bottom-left corner. The mural is 24 x 44 ft.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Raccoon Food Truck]</title>
    <creator>Lucido, Michael</creator>
    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Artist Michael Lucido's electric-box mural depicts a food truck driven and manned by raccoons serving skateboards. The raccoon driving the truck wears sunglasses, his mouth is open with his tongue hanging out, his right arm hangs out the open window of the truck, and is raised up in the air with a &quot;sign of the horns&quot; gesture (the index finger and the little finger are upright and the thumb is clasped against the two middle fingers) on his hand. Another sunglass-wearing raccoon with a big-open smile on his face sits on the serving counter of the truck under a brown awning with his right foot resting on the back of a skateboard. His right hand flashes the &quot;shaka&quot; sign, also known as the &quot;hang loose&quot; sign, while he holds a red beverage in his left hand. Behind this raccoon, inside the truck, hang two rows of four vibrantly-colored skateboards. A fire-extinguisher cabinet with the message &quot;In Case of Emergency Event Break Glass&quot; painted on it hangs behind the raccoon that sits on the counter, but instead of containing a fire extinguisher, it contains an aqua-blue skateboard with pink wheels. The skateboard-food-truck theme of this box possibly relates to its location at City Park Plaza, used in the past as an unofficial skate park, and to the food-truck culture that has developed in the area over the past several years.</description>

    <description>In this mural painted on a warehouse on Dickerson Road, artist Anthony Ortega stays true to his style and paints an intergalactic mural. Amidst the black and purple background emerges an array of alien scenes. On the right, a man enters (or exits) a green-lit hallway, next to him enters a UFO occupied with visitors from another world or galaxy. Underneath the UFO, someone is being abducted by another UFO at the top of the mural, further reinforced by how its green rays morph the individual's skin to an alien-like green color.</description>

    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2013</date>
    <description>This mural painted by artist Erik Burke embraces the history of Nevada. Similar to his other murals, this work is composed of two main elements: a landscape, and the words &quot;GO WEST.&quot; The landscape depicts the variety of mountain ranges in Nevada, suggested by the variety of color (shades of red and blue) in which they are painted. The landscape also portrays a wild mustang, an animal representative of the &quot;wild west&quot; nature of Nevada. On the right side of the mural appears a female figure holding a lantern, as if guiding the horse and throwing into relief the words &quot;GO WEST.&quot; The words are painted in a subtle yellow and white that merges them into the landscape. The lines in between the words, which depict birch trees with Basque tree carvings that are found in the state, weave in front of and behind the mustang and run parallel (and in some cases line up directly with) the building behind the mural (the Silver Legacy Hotel &amp; Casino), further connecting the mural to the city. </description>

    <description>The mural on the left, painted by HS, combines graffiti with vibrant animation. Silly monkeys and a cockatoo perched on a branch flank the vibrant graffiti text that emerges from green leaves. The mural on the right, painted by members of UTI Crew, depicts imagery associated with heavy metal band Iron Maiden. The mummy, skeletons, graveyard, and ominous skylines can all be found on various album covers and merchandise. Various graffiti-style words (likely the artists' monikers) appear throughout the mural.</description>

    <description>Each side of Bryce Chisholm's signal box portrays a distinct image. On the front, a young girl wearing a floral headpiece sits on the ground and looks down happily at something she holds in her left hand.  The girl was painted against a vibrant yellow background using black, white, and blue paint and a stencil (a technique Chisholm is known for). A teal and lavender hummingbird (also painted using a stencil) silhouetted in magenta and aqua blue hovers behind and to the left of the girl, and the sun sitting behind the girl casts heather-purple rays. Three white damask patterns have been painted in succession (using stencil) on the right side of the box, and a geometric pattern has been painted in magenta in the upper-left corner of the box.</description>

    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock pays homage to the renowned artist, Georgia O'Keefe, through a surrealist-style head (that of O'Keefe, according to Rock) that explodes with ideas. The mountain on her left shoulder, as well as the hanging flower, refer subjects in O'Keefe's own artworks. Rock adds a twist to the O'Keefe style by incorporating words in different font styles and vibrant colors such as pink, purple, green, and yellow.</description>

    <description>The scholastic theme of this mural by artist Joe C. Rock relates to its location on a wall of the building that used to house the Rainshadow Community Charter High School. The boy, who wears a tan hat and matching shirt with the the Rolling Stones iconic lips and tongue logo on it, carries graded assignments and a copy of Tolstoy's War and Peace in his left arm as he and his dog (with a crown floating above its head: a common object in Rock's murals) run through the tall trees. Books, one open with a house emerging from its pages, float around the boy, perhaps they have flown out of his blue backpack. A red bird perches on a tree branch behind the boy and three lady bugs fly around the bottom of the mural, two behind the dog and one by the boy's right foot.</description>

    <contributor>Nevada Fine Arts</contributor>
    <date>2013</date>
    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock pays homage to the renowned artist, Georgia O'Keefe, through a surrealist-style head (that of O'Keefe, according to Rock) that explodes with ideas. The mountain on her left shoulder, as well as the hanging flower, refer subjects in O'Keefe's own artworks. Rock adds a twist to the O'Keefe style by incorporating words in different font styles and vibrant colors such as pink, purple, green, and yellow.</description>

    <title>In the Midst of Midtown</title>
    <creator>Rock, Joe C.</creator>
    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>As artist Joe C. Rock explains on his website: &amp;quot;This mural was created as an ode to the history of the Midtown area in Reno, NV.  The word 'Midtown' covers the wall in painted exposed brick, transitioning from new, to worn down, to built back up with metal and brackets, just as the area has [b]een throughout the years. Vintage ads and photographs of [influential] people and businesses, [as well as] imagery that helped build up the area are recreated in spray paint and house paint [and] collaged about in a makeshift timeline of the area [that leads] up to a motel sign from the street, re-lettered to say 'look to the future.' A child adorned in an American-flag dress with Lady Liberty's crown, torch, and tablets looks blindly into the future.&amp;quot;</description>

    <contributor>Children's Cabinet; Reno Police Department;</contributor>
    <date>2017;</date>
    <description>The mural on the two adjacent back walls of Mountain Music Parlor was painted by a group of youth who are part of the Children's Cabinet's &quot;Spray Positive&quot; program. This program was instigated by the Reno Police Department, in collaboration with the Children's Cabinet, as a way to beautify blighted properties in Midtown and Downtown Reno. A dream catcher with music notes in the web leads to the head of a Native-American figure wearing an elaborate headdress. An American flag emerges from the left side of the headdress and straddles both walls. A portrait of a man in a cowboy hat (most likely bluegrass musician Bill Monroe) painted in front of the flag graces the adjacent wall, and the mural concludes with a rendering of a chick playing a cello with the name &quot;Bill Monroe&quot; painted above it.</description>

    <contributor>NA</contributor>
    <date>2011-2013</date>
    <description>The mural on the left depicts two portraits of female faces along with other figures and patterns. The woman painted in shades of red and pink looks down while the woman painted in blue stares as if looking ahead. To the left side of the blue woman, a pink animated figure seems to combine elements of the human face and a cat. It emerges from the bottom of the wall and becomes more enlarged as it reaches the top of the mural. It has a fierce face, depicted by the stern four eyes and the showing of its teeth. In the mural on the far right, Anthony Ortega stays true to his style and paints an intergalactic mural. Amidst the black and purple background emerges an array of alien scenes. On the right, a man enters (or exits) a green-lit hallway, next to him enters a UFO occupied with visitors from another world or galaxy. Underneath the UFO, someone is being abducted by another UFO at the top of the mural, further reinforced by how its green rays morph the individual's skin to an alien-like green color. In the middle of the mural appears another green woman making a phone call, while a city rests above her. Lastly, on the left side resides an eerie church with the words &quot;THEY LIVE&quot; appearing above the church.</description>

This mural is painted with vibrant shades of blue, red, green, orange, yellow, pink, and purple, portraying a vivid ancient Mesoamerican god-like figure that emerges from the stellar depths of the galaxy behind it and begins its descent into the green forest that surrounds the outer edges of the mural.</description>

    <title>Visionary</title>
    <creator>Burke, Erik; Burke, Erik (OverUnder);</creator>
    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2015</date>
    <description>Visionary, painted by Erik Burke, focuses on the bright and deep-blue eyes of what appears to be a female, looking up in wonder, imagination, or inquiry, as the mural's title suggests. Set against a light blue background, Burke utilized the natural color of the brick wall to represent the figure's skin tone. The mural is painted using a simple color palette of red, orange, brown, and a few different shades of blue, as well as black for the eyelashes and brows. Burke tied the red, orange, brown and blue into the geometric pattern painted on the sliding door that sits in the center of the wall/mural.</description>

    <date>2014</date>
    <description>This signal box was painted by artist Michael Lucido to look like it has been boarded up and turned into a raccoon fort, as the mural's title suggests. On the left side of the box, a wide-eyed raccoon leaning back with its mouth wide open about to devour a piece of pepperoni pizza peaks out through an opening in the boards. Its tail pokes out through an opening between the boards. Below this, the words &quot;Insert Food&quot; and arrows, both painted red, surround and point to another opening between the boards.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Octopus, Peacock Feathers, Futuristic Head]</title>
    <creator>Pittman, Adam (Naem); Pittman, Adam;</creator>
    <contributor>The Melting Pot World Emporium &amp; Smoke Shop</contributor>
    <date>2015</date>
    <description>This mural depicts a large brown octopus mixed with peacock feathers and a human-like figure. The octopus is the focus of the mural. The body of the octopus is painted in a palette of browns, while its suckers are painted in a palette of blue. The peacock feathers almost resemble the suckers as they intertwine into the octopus's tentacles. The tentacles wrap around and burst through a portrait of a blue human-like figure wearing headphones that emerges from the mud-cracked ground, perhaps representing Burning Man since the business upon which the mural is painted, The Melting Pot World Emporium, is one of the leading retailers of Playa gear in the area. The figure stares out into the distance. A tentacle bursts through the middle portrait, which depicts the Burning Man logo centered in the Burning-Man-Playa landscape with planets hanging in the night sky above. The last portrait is a circus-style wall sign for the The Melting Pot. A curtain opens up to a stage with silhouettes of people dancing in front of an earth with sun rays around it. The background of the entire mural is painted a bright red, contrasting the aquatic and desert ambiance of the subject matter. </description>

    <contributor>Becerra, Manny;</contributor>
    <date>2013</date>
    <description>This 65 x (roughly) 16 foot mural pinated on the wall of Peerless Cleaners by artist Erik Burke combines Reno history and Nevada mountain ranges. The mural is speckled with small symbols that depict prominent Reno figures, organizations, and locations in the business's and city's history. Some of these symbols are connected, like constellations, by a line that carries throughout the composition. The mountain-range landscape can also be interpreted as draped fabric, connecting the mural to the the business located in that building. The mural is painted in shades of red, orange, yellow, blue and white.</description>

    <description>Artist Stephane Cellier used the natural angles of the wall upon which he painted this monochromatic mural during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017 to create an optical illusion. An &quot;x&quot; accompanied by &quot;please stand here to view the mural&quot; is painted on the the ground, marking the &quot;sweet spot&quot; from where the intended depiction of the mural can be correctly and fully observed: a man receiving a kiss on the cheek from a woman with words above that read &quot;Two Smiles Getting Closer End Up Making...A Kiss.&quot; Viewed head-on, the mural is a distorted mess. </description>

    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>A rendering of Marilyn Monroe eating a burger appears on the back side of Vaka's signal-box mural. Monroe lifts the burger up to her mouth, ready to take a bight. A salt shaker sits in the lower-left corner. The content and theme of the mural (the classic car and Monroe eating a burger) relates to the location in which the signal box resides: in front of Juicy's Giant Hamburgers, a popular restaurant in Reno with the feel of an old-fashioned burger joint.</description>

    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock pays homage to the renowned artist, Georgia O'Keefe, through a surrealist-style head (that of O'Keefe, according to Rock) that explodes with ideas. The mountain on her left shoulder, as well as the hanging flower, refer subjects in O'Keefe's own artworks. Rock adds a twist to the O'Keefe style by incorporating words in different font styles and vibrant colors such as pink, purple, green, and yellow.</description>

    <title>Georgia On My Mind; Unknown [Hands Balancing Stones]; Rebuilding the Block</title>
    <creator>Rock, Joe C.; Burke, Erik; Burke, Erik (OverUnder); Nanook;</creator>
    <contributor>Nevada Fine Arts</contributor>
    <date>2013</date>
    <description>This wall on the west side of the building occupied by Nevada Fine Arts contains six 16 x 20 ft. panels, each painted by a different artist. From left to right: Artist Joe C. Rock pays homage to the renowned artist, Georgia O'Keefe, through a surrealist-style head (that of O'Keefe, according to Rock) that explodes with ideas. The mountain on her left shoulder, as well as the hanging flower, refer subjects in O'Keefe's own artworks. Rock adds a twist to the O'Keefe style by incorporating words in different font styles and vibrant colors such as pink, purple, green, and yellow; Artist Nanook portrays hands emerging from a turquoise background balancing stones. A blue and green ikat patterned snake-like object winds through the mural, separating the turquoise background from the abstract blue sky above; Erik Burke describes his mural, Rebuilding the Block, as &quot;a texture dense field of western motifs and a deconstructed cinder block. Atop the pattern sits yellow lines demarcating the layout of the streets, a mile in every direction. A pair of eyes represent the creative visionaries atop a city determined to reinvent itself without any luck or success. The nearby peak of Mt. Rose is anchored at the base of the wall, covering the mouth and serving as a reference point for Reno's most regarded resource...Lake Tahoe&quot; (eriktburke.com). A gray cinder block floats in front of a person's forehead, framed by hair. Piercing blue eyes stare at the viewer as the facial features begin to fade at the bridge of the nose. Blue, green, and red triangles in ones, twos, and threes speckle the mural and comprise Lake Tahoe at the bottom of the mural, with Mt. Rose rising above. Faint yellow lines representing roads/streets cover the mural.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Raccoon Food Truck]</title>
    <creator>Lucido, Michael</creator>
    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Artist Michael Lucido's electric-box mural depicts a food truck driven and manned by raccoons serving skateboards. The raccoon driving the truck wears sunglasses, his mouth is open with his tongue hanging out, his right arm hangs out the open window of the truck, and is raised up in the air with a &quot;sign of the horns&quot; gesture (the index finger and the little finger are upright and the thumb is clasped against the two middle fingers) on his hand. Another sunglass-wearing raccoon with a big-open smile on his face sits on the serving counter of the truck under a brown awning with his right foot resting on the back of a skateboard. His right hand flashes the &quot;shaka&quot; sign, also known as the &quot;hang loose&quot; sign, while he holds a red beverage in his left hand. Behind this raccoon, inside the truck, hang two rows of four vibrantly-colored skateboards. A fire-extinguisher cabinet with the message &quot;In Case of Emergency Event Break Glass&quot; painted on it hangs behind the raccoon that sits on the counter, but instead of containing a fire extinguisher, it contains an aqua-blue skateboard with pink wheels. The skateboard-food-truck theme of this box possibly relates to its location at City Park Plaza, used in the past as an unofficial skate park, and to the food-truck culture that has developed in the area over the past several years.</description>

    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2012</date>
    <description>In this collaborative piece painted by Erik Burke, Kelly Peyton, and Kaitlyn Bryson, a male figure wearing dark blue jeans and a yellow tank top lays on his back in front of a blue background with hands interlaced and resting on his stomach. It appears as though the man is floating. In the bottom-left corner of the mural, circular, triangular, other geometric shapes, and dashes are painted on the man's pants in a shade of blue lighter than the pants and more like that of the background. Similar shapes are painted in marigold yellow on the man's shirt, as are figures fashioned out of the letters &quot;L&quot; and &quot;D&quot; and the number &quot;4&quot; (L4, D4); these figures represent the phrase &quot;Live for What You Would Die For.&quot; These figures, and the phrase they represent, likely relate to the theme and purpose of the mural, referred to by one if its painters, Burke, as a tribute to Beau Shaver of Reno, NV who is also likely the man depicted in the mural. The man also has various shapes (hearts, roses, the outline of a crown) and words painted in yellow on his arm, neck, face and teeth. The background of the right side of the mural is painted in graduated shades of blue (light to dark, from the bottom to the top). An upside down brown hat appears in the lower-right corner of the mural, it has currant-red-outlined-in-yellow flowers sitting on the brim and one flower peaking out from inside. Burke's moniker (OU33), the other two artists' initials (KP and Kb), and the date (2012) are painted in white in the upper-right corner of the mural, with &quot;L4D4 SODC SHAVER&quot; painted below. The mural is 80 x 16 ft. </description>

White music notes float around the musician, near where his guitar rests. A hand with the &quot;sign of the horns&quot; gesture on it rises from the bottom of the mural, beside it, the word &quot;Rock&quot; is painted in black within a white text bubble. Peach and green geometric shapes overlapping each other are painted on the lower half of the left side of the mural.</description>

    <description>The two roller doors of the Reno Fire Department station in downtown Reno each depict different fire helmets: on the left is a dark-brown leather helmet with a red leather shield affixed to the front that reads &quot;RFD 1 Engine;&quot; on the right, a black leather (likely) helmet with a brass eagle adornment affixed to the top of the helmet to secure a leather shield that reads &quot;Reno Fire Firefighter Truck 1&quot; to the front helmet front. The crown (an object that appears in many of Rock's murals) on the eagle's head is not found on actual helmets. Smoke emerges from behind both helmets. In the lower-left side of the left door is a monochromatic scene depicting three firefighters and a fire engine. In lower-right side of the right door is a monochromatic scene depicting a firefighter manning the deluge gun on top of a fire engine. On the right third of the left door and the left third of the right door is another monochromatic scene depicting two firefighters (or one split in half by the wall between the two doors) fully suited up and wearing a helmet with respirator, while three people climb a ladder in the background to the right.</description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>This mural is composed by several artists, Joe C. Rock and Jennifer Charboneau among them. The left-hand side, painted by G. Orlandoyack, consists of vibrant pinks and blues with female-looking subjects. The middle, painted by Rock,  features a woman's face partially covered by a fan, behind which the face takes on the appearance of a Day of the Day skull. The mural is composed using black, white, gray and shades of blue. The right side, painted by Charboneau, consists of a darker palette with a more abstract expressionist brushstroke and depicts an idle woman wearing a red shirt, blue skirt, and heels sitting at a bar having a drink. The only other recognizable object is the table adjacent to the woman.</description>

    <description>Devin Hosselkus' signal-box mural depicts various individuals in a city-like setting (perhaps downtown Reno, given the location of the box just north of the Virginia Street Bridge over the Truckee River). In the foreground of the front side of the box is the profile of a person with gray hair and purple skin, wearing a green shirt and brown paints, apparently walking towards the left. In the background and what appears to be across the street, from left to right: a person wearing a white shirt and blue pants sits on a wooden bench in a front of a brick building; a man wearing a white tank tops looks across the street; a man with blue skin, wearing a white shirt and brown pants walks towards the left; a person wearing a maroon shirt walks in the opposite direction; a person wearing a white bandana, black shirt and gray pants has their back turned away from the viewer. A body of water (presumably the Truckee River) flows under a bridge and street lights behind and to the right of the person in the foreground.</description>

    <date>2011</date>
    <description>This hardware-themed mural was painted by artist Joe C. Rock on the southern wall of Ace Hardware in Midtown Reno. On the left side of the mural, a can of red paint pours down from the top onto a wooden paint stirrer stick with the Ace logo on it. On the left, a paint brush has been dipped in the red paint and a paint roller above the brush has been rolled in the paint. In the scene on the right side of the mural, a man wearing a white chef's hat and apron is barbecuing or deep frying a turkey in a fenced-in yard surrounded by tall pine trees. Rock has utilized the natural brick facade of the wall to depict the brick patio the man stands on, and the blue sky behind and above him flows into the blue label on the paint can. </description>

    <date>2014</date>
    <description>This signal box was painted by artist Michael Lucido to look like it has been boarded up and turned into a raccoon fort, as the mural's title suggests. On the front side of the box, a wide-eyed raccoon with its mouth wide open peaks out through an opening between the boards, a bare fish skeleton dangles from its left paw, its tail pokes out through a hole in a board. The words &quot;Raccoons Only&quot; appear in red below the raccoon, and Lucido's last name, website (www.thatlucidokid.com) and the date are painted in black at the very bottom of the box. On the right side of the box, a wide-eyed raccoon with its mouth wide open stands outside the fort with a Campbell's Tomato Soup can in its left paw and a paint brush in its right paw. Red tomato soup is on the tip of the brush, as well as on the raccoon's tongue and around its mouth. The words &quot;Rad City&quot; are painted in red on a board above the raccoon's head.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Aquatic Elements: Mural for Stingray Tattoo]</title>
    <creator>Vaka</creator>
    <contributor>Stingray Tattoo</contributor>
    <date>2014-2016</date>
    <description>This under-the-sea-themed mural was painted by artist Vaka on the exterior of Stingray Tattoo, where he works as a tattoo artist. Several dark blue stingrays swim throughout the mural that wraps around two adjacent walls on the northeast side of the tattoo parlor, covers the ceiling that overhangs the walls and spills into the pavement below. Two orange, white and black clown fish swim through some purple sea anemones and and light blue sponges that emerge from the bottom corner of the mural where the two walls meet. On the far right side (northern wall) of the mural, a massive ray swims towards some red coral that flanks a window. On the left side (eastern wall) of the mural, a word (possibly &quot;Ink&quot;) is painted red and white in flourish font, while the same paint colors are used on the cinderblocks of the wall to create the illusion that the wall is breaking and falling into the sea; several of these broken blocks float throughout the mural.</description>

    <description>Artists Nanook paints a bull with rooster-patterned fur against a white background with a dark aegean-blue border at the bottom. Three large black circles with mustard-yellow outlines and flowers with dark-red centers speckle the mural and one large red circle appears in the center of the mural. A prominent cerulean-blue curvy line with a lighter and thinner line next to it horizontally spans the mural, weaving through and around the circles and bull. In the bottom left corner of the mural, Nanook's moniker and the date have been painted in the same blue as the curvy line against the dark aegean-blue border.</description>

    <creator>Pittman, Adam (Naem); Pittman, Adam;</creator>
    <contributor>The Melting Pot World Emporium &amp; Smoke Shop</contributor>
    <date>2015</date>
    <description>This mural depicts a large brown octopus mixed with peacock feathers and a human-like figure. The octopus is the focus of the mural. The body of the octopus is painted in a palette of browns, while its suckers are painted in a palette of blue. The peacock feathers almost resemble the suckers as they intertwine into the octopus's tentacles. The tentacles wrap around and burst through a portrait of a blue human-like figure wearing headphones that emerges from the mud-cracked ground, perhaps representing Burning Man since the business upon which the mural is painted, The Melting Pot World Emporium, is one of the leading retailers of Playa gear in the area. The figure stares out into the distance. A tentacle bursts through the middle portrait, which depicts the Burning Man logo centered in the Burning-Man-Playa landscape with planets hanging in the night sky above. The last portrait is a circus-style wall sign for the The Melting Pot. A curtain opens up to a stage with silhouettes of people dancing in front of an earth with sun rays around it. The background of the entire mural is painted a bright red, contrasting the aquatic and desert ambiance of the subject matter.</description>

    <creator>Rock, Joe C.</creator>
    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>As its name suggest, this mural by artist Joe C. Rock depicts a man daydreaming as he lays (or floats) on his back in (or above) the grass underneath a sky populated by white-puffy clouds. A butterfly perches on his Davey-Crockett-coonskin hat that floats away from his head, which has another butterfly perched on it with another butterfly flying slightly above it. A lit cigarette floats away from his mouth, and a bluebird perches on his blue jacket that has the Nevada state seal on the upper right arm. A raccoon crawls between the man's lower legs towards a black book with a blue and white &quot;Hello My Name Is&quot; name tag on it; &quot;Joe C.&quot; is written on the name tag. The book is attached to a line that wraps around the man's left leg and has a hook with a worm attached that dangles in front of the bluebird. A tiny pair of eyeglasses floats between the worm and bird. To the right of the book, a marmot-like animal with a crown (a common object in Rock's murals) floating above its head stands on its hind legs in the grass facing towards to man. Behind the animal, in the distance, there is a green house with power lines suspended on poles overhead.</description>

    <creator>Burke, Erik; Burke, Erik (OverUnder);</creator>
    <contributor>The Hudson Project</contributor>
    <date>2013</date>
    <description>According to artist Erik Burke who painted this 18 x 50 foot mural, &quot;The Hudson Project is a block of mixed-use urban infill development between Center and Lake Street on State Street. The mural graces the east side of the development and is a visualization of all the people and business that inhabited this block dating back to 1890&quot; (http://eriktburke.com/Hudson-Project). The upper portion of the left side of the mural is composed of various vibrant shades of green while the bottom portion depicting a landscape is composed of a vibrant blue, brown/tan, yellow, and more green. The right side of the mural is a wheat pasted silhouette profile of a man conducting a land survey against a large white circle (perhaps representing the moon). This technique creates a life-like, almost 3D depiction of the man, the colors of which tie in with the left portion of the mural.</description>

A black mountainous skyline with &quot;Reno&quot; painted over it in pink is depicted in the car's license plate. Vaka's moniker is painted on the top of the right side in purple and white. The content and theme of the mural (the classic car and Monroe eating a burger) relates to the location in which the signal box resides: in front of Juicy's Giant Hamburgers, a popular restaurant in Reno with the feel of an old-fashioned burger joint. </description>

    <description>Five panels of this wall were painted by five different artists during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017. The three here are by artists Emily Reid, Lisa Kurt and Joshua Coffy. Reid depicts a cow in her mural. Reid paints the background shades of green and blue and the cow is outlined over these colors. Kurt paints a black fox standing in a meadow within a forest landscape. Surrounding the fox are trees, bushes, tumbleweed and a ghost. Kurt uses yellow, orange, green, black, and white to paint this mural. Coffy's mural features a black bear with ryukin goldfish swimming around it. The bottom third of the mural's background is an aegean-blue color, perhaps representative of water, while the rest of the background is tan with chiffon circles (or bubbles). A grid of eleven colors has been painted in the top middle of the mural.</description>

    <contributor>Blum Reno</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits, spanning the entire 250 x 20 foot mural. The portraits, from left to right, are as follows: Frederic DeLongchamps, one of Nevada's most prolific architects; Dot So La Lee, a basket weaver and member of the northwestern Nevada Washoe; Wovoka, a Paiute religious leader; Ben Palmer, one of the original settlers of and most successful ranchers in the Carson Valley; Michael Heizer, a contemporary artist whose life-long project, City, is &quot;the largest piece of contemporary art ever attempted&quot; (http://doublenegative.tarasen.net/city/)&quot;; Jeanne Wier, founder of the Nevada Historical Society; Abraham Lincoln, whose re-election in 1864 was largely due to Nevada's expedited entry into statehood; Jack Johnson, who, after winning a bout against James Jeffries in Reno, NV in 1910, became the first African American world heavyweight boxing champion; Sarah Winnemucca, a Northern Paiute activist from Nevada; and Mark Twain, who lived and wrote for a newspaper in Virginia City and Carson City, NV in the early 1860s. Each portrait contains a detail pertaining to the individual, for example: buildings on top of DeLonghamps' head; a basket behind the top of Dot So La Lee's head; a brand surrounded by barbed wire on top of Palmer's head; Heizer wears a hat that appears sculpted from metal to symbolize his work as a sculptor; a rendering of the Nevada Historical Society in the broach pinned to Weir's collar; the US Highway sign imposed on Lincoln's head is symbolic of his namesake, US Route 40; a rendering of Johnson knocking Jeffries out during the championship bout; and the top of Twain's head represented as an open book, and a quill pen over his right shoulder.</description>

    <description>During the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, artist Ricky Lee Gordon painted a female figure with the word &quot;NATURE&quot; hovering over her. Gordon uses dark colors to obscure the woman's face. The woman represents the Native American community in northern Nevada and the importance of conserving nature. A message in the lower-right corner of the mural reads &quot;Nature Conspires with Spirit to Emancipate Us.&quot;</description>

    <description>The front side of Cathy Ashworth's signal-box mural portrays Reno pride. In the center of the work lies a red heart with a banner across it that reads &quot;Reno.&quot; Like the back of the box, fire also arises from the heart and the Burning Man logo appears in the main flame. The background is then divided into sections that depict scenery relating to northern Nevada.</description>

    <contributor>Children's Cabinet; Reno Police Department;</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>The mural on the two adjacent back walls of Mountain Music Parlor was painted by a group of youth who are part of the Children's Cabinet's &quot;Spray Positive&quot; program. This program was instigated by the Reno Police Department, in collaboration with the Children's Cabinet, as a way to beautify blighted properties in Midtown and Downtown Reno. A dream catcher with music notes in the web leads to the head of a Native-American figure wearing an elaborate headdress. An American flag emerges from the left side of the headdress and straddles both walls. A portrait of a man in a cowboy hat (most likely bluegrass musician Bill Monroe) painted in front of the flag graces the adjacent wall, and the mural concludes with a rendering of a chick playing a cello with the name &quot;Bill Monroe&quot; painted above it.</description>

    <description>These two murals are painted on garage doors along the back exterior wall of the West Street Market. On the left, sharp geometric mountains painted in rich shades or red, orange, and yellow against an aqua, turquoise and teal blue sky are the focal point of this mural. On the right, a big horn sheep gazes up towards the body of another sheep (or perhaps its own detached body). The figures are painted in red outline and shadowing agains a vibrant blue background. Bubbles emerge from the bottom of the mural and bright orange and green beams cast their color on the sheep head and body.</description>

    <description>In this mural painted on a warehouse on Dickerson Road, artist Anthony Ortega stays true to his style and paints an intergalactic mural. Amidst the black and purple background emerges an array of alien scenes. On the right, a man enters (or exits) a green-lit hallway, next to him enters a UFO occupied with visitors from another world or galaxy. Underneath the UFO, someone is being abducted by another UFO at the top of the mural, further reinforced by how its green rays morph the individual's skin to an alien-like green color. In the middle of the mural appears another green woman making a phone call, while a city rests above her. Lastly, on the left side resides an eerie church with the words &quot;THEY LIVE&quot; appearing above the church.</description>

    <description>The eastern wall of the Circus Circus Reno contains seven 20 x 14 ft. panels, each painted by a different artist during the 2017 24-Hour Mural Marathon competition. From left to right: Anthony Ortega won the competition with a psychedelic mural composition that combines ancient Mesoamerican art with futuristic elements. This mural is painted with vibrant shades of blue, red, green, orange, yellow, pink, and purple, portraying a vivid ancient Mesoamerican god-like figure that emerges from the stellar depths of the galaxy behind it and begins it descent into the green forest that surrounds the outer edges of the mural; Kendel Leslie painted a colorful mural with a blue humpback whale as the primary subject. The whale is painted in several shades of blue and purple. The background is composed of different shapes and formed in light pink, magenta, lime green, pastel yellow and purple among a black background with white stars, alluding to a galaxy-like ocean; Artist Raphael Blanco's mural d</description>

    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>As artist Joe C. Rock explains on his website: &quot;This mural was created as an ode to the history of the Midtown area in Reno, NV.  The word 'Midtown' covers the wall in painted exposed brick, transitioning from new, to worn down, to built back up with metal and brackets, just as the area has [b]een throughout the years. Vintage ads and photographs of [influential] people and businesses, [as well as] imagery that helped build up the area are recreated in spray paint and house paint [and] collaged about in a makeshift timeline of the area [that leads] up to a motel sign from the street, re-lettered to say 'look to the future.' A child adorned in an American-flag dress with Lady Liberty's crown, torch, and tablets looks blindly into the future.&quot;</description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Artist Kyler Martz painted this mural in a style reminiscent of American traditional tattoo during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October, 2017. It depicts a tattoo-covered woman in a red swimsuit with white polka dots riding a trout on Lake Tahoe with the snow-peaked Sierras in the background. A cowboy hat is strapped around her neck and blowing behind her. This scene is flanked by two tattoo-covered women in white and gray (one striped, one with a fish-scale pattern) swimsuits riding sea horses and holding a tan banner that reads &quot;Lake Tahoe 1959&quot; over their heads with their free hands. The women have red bandanas around their necks, and the sea horses have red dorsal fins. A red banner that reads &quot;Queen of the Rodeo&quot; runs across the bottom of the mural.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Headquarters Bar Crawl Mural]</title>
    <creator>UTI Crew; Spek;</creator>
    <contributor>Art Spot Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>The theme of this vibrant mural, painted by members of UTI Crew during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, directly relates to the location in which it is painted: the wall of Headquarters Bar, a bar owned and operated by &quot;Crawl Reno, the organizers of the Reno Zombie Crawl and a ton of other massive parties in downtown Reno&quot; (http://headquartersreno.com/#home_about). On the right side of the mural stands a man with characteristics representative of the various crawls that take place in Reno throughout the year. The red Santa hat he wears with gold polka dots and a gold fur ball gestures towards the Santa Crawl; his green beard gestures towards the Leprechaun Crawl; and the Superman shirt he wears gestures towards the Super Hero Crawl. On the left side of the mural is a zombie with a mask resting on the top of its head, representing both the Zombie and Mardi Gras Crawls. These two figures flank four separate graffiti-style words (one of which appears to be the moniker of one of the UTI Crew members, Spek). In the background of the mural, a city skyline goes up in flames, perhaps caused by the man on the left who holds a lit match in his right hand, a mug of bear in his left. To the left of the mural is a small chain link fence with wood slats upon which &quot;The Crawl&quot; is painted in aqua, turquoise and sky blue horror font against a yellow and orange background with red splatters.</description>

    <description>This mural is a three-part piece painted by artist Joe C. Rock. The fence here (of three total) depicts a hand-drawn rudimentary map representing Sparks, Reno, Virginia City and Carson City, Nevada. The sage brush that grows horizontally behind the map peaks through holes in the map and the golden-yellow banner from the Nevada state flag wraps around and through the entire seen. A monochromatic portrait of Kit Carson is painted on the-right side of the fence.</description>

    <description>This panoramic photo captures most of the murals that grace the walls of what is known as &quot;Taylor Alley.&quot; On the left, this graffiti mural by UTI Crew demonstrates the vast array of graffiti writing styles. The artists of these pieces use a bright palette and caricatures to heighten the visual element of the text. On the right, the mural on the far left, painted by HS, combines graffiti with vibrant animation. Silly monkeys and a cockatoo perched on a branch flank the vibrant graffiti text that emerges from green leaves. The mural to the right of this, painted by members of UTI Crew, depicts imagery associated with heavy metal band Iron Maiden. The mummy, skeletons, graveyard, and ominous skylines can all be found on various album covers and merchandise. Various graffiti-style words (likely the artists' monikers) appear throughout the mural.</description>

    <date>2013</date>
    <description>This 65 x (roughly) 16 foot mural pinated on the wall of Peerless Cleaners by artist Erik Burke combines Reno history and Nevada mountain ranges. The mural is speckled with small symbols that depict prominent Reno figures, organizations, and locations in the business's and city's history. Some of these symbols are connected, like constellations, by a line that carries throughout the composition. The mountain-range landscape can also be interpreted as draped fabric, connecting the mural to the the business located in that building. The mural is painted in shades of red, orange, yellow, blue and white.</description>

    <description>&quot;DAYDREAM!&quot; appears in all caps in this mural that artist Joe C. Rock painted on a chain link fence with wood slats. Enclosed within the block letters is green grass against a blue skyline. The letters are outlined in white and cast red shadows outlined in peach. Growing out of the grass in the first &quot;D&quot; is a blue flower. A butterfly with blue wings perches on the outside edge of the second &quot;D&quot; and a lady bug crawls across the grass. A red rose rests on the left side of the &quot;R.&quot; A worm slithers through the grass, straddling the right side of the &quot;R&quot; and left side of the &quot;E,&quot; disappearing and re-emerging out of the right side of the &quot;E.&quot; A blue flower with a lady bug on it grows out of the grass in the dot of the exclamation point.</description>

    <date>2016</date>
    <description>As artist Joe C. Rock explains on his website: &quot;This mural was created as an ode to the history of the Midtown area in Reno, NV.  The word 'Midtown' covers the wall in painted exposed brick, transitioning from new, to worn down, to built back up with metal and brackets, just as the area has [b]een throughout the years. Vintage ads and photographs of [influential] people and businesses, [as well as] imagery that helped build up the area are recreated in spray paint and house paint [and] collaged about in a makeshift timeline of the area [that leads] up to a motel sign from the street, re-lettered to say 'look to the future.' A child adorned in an American-flag dress with Lady Liberty's crown, torch, and tablets looks blindly into the future.&quot; </description>

    <date>2011</date>
    <description>This monochromatic mural, originally painted for Lulu's Chic Boutique (now Timeless Fashion Consignment Shop and Bridal Salon) by artist Joe C. Rock, consists of a variety of geometric shapes, designs, patterns, and objects. The top portion of the mural is comprised of black polka dots. Water or mountains (what is actually the hair of a woman painted on the adjacent right or east-facing wall) flows from from the right, rising and then encircling the business logo painted in the center of the wall with the moon rising above it to the left. The logo is flanked on the left by the Eiffel Tower and on the right by the profile of a monocle-wearing man with a curly handlebar mustache whose top hat is the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Centered below the logo is an ornate fleurs-de-lis flanked by botehs (the teardrop-shaped motif with a curved upper end that comprises the paisley pattern). More fleurs-de-lis and botehs, as well as another top-hat-wearing figure, diamonds, various-sized squares, circles/dots, and flourish patterns speckle the left side of the mural. Rock brings a little color into the far-left side of the mural (under the window), where he has painted his moniker and some red dots (a few also appear to the left of and above the window).</description>

    <title>Unknown [Head in the Clouds]</title>
    <creator>Rock, Joe C.</creator>
    <contributor>NA</contributor>
    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>A fluid mural is painted by artist Joe C. Rock on this three-sided fence. The mural begins with the head of a woman in front of clouds whose hair then flows throughout the mural, as do the clouds. An array of subject matter appear among the hair and clouds over a light-blue background. While some figures portray recognizable figures, such as dice, eye balls, power lines, butterflies, rain drops, a bee, a rose, a mountain range, and botehs (the teardrop-shaped motif with a curved upper end that comprises the paisley pattern), other subjects and figures are more abstract, or focus on written text.</description>

    <date>2014</date>
    <description>A close up of the right side of a wolf's head and face appears on the right side of Vaka and Sarra's mural. The wolf's fur is multicolored: muted shades of purple, yellow, green, blue, and orange. The wolf's eye is a mint green. Two brown hand prints appear towards the bottom of the left side of the box. The wolf likely relates to the signal box's proximity to the University of Nevada, Reno, whose mascot is the wolf.</description>

    <contributor>Ponderosa Meat &amp; Provision Co.</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Ponderous, painted by Erik Burke on a metal meat freezer at Ponderosa Meat &amp; Provision Co., features a portrait of John Muir on the left in front of snow-covered mountains and a body of water, flanked by an open hand about to receive a pine cone, with white and gray stripes running through the scene. Burke used a simple color palette consisting of white, black, grays and browns. The description of the mural on Burke's website is as follows: &quot;Correlating the etymology of the building's namesake and John Muir, a profound advocate for the preservation and enjoyment of the nearby Sierras. The mural places a pondering and monochromatic Muir in a winter landscape next to a hand catching a falling pinecone as an allegory for the weight of man's relationship with nature. A trinity of lines helps order the various planes and build a stage of depth.&quot;</description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Artist Kyler Martz painted this mural in a style reminiscent of American traditional tattoo during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October, 2017. It depicts a tattoo-covered woman in a red swimsuit with white polka dots riding a trout on Lake Tahoe with the snow-peaked Sierras in the background. A cowboy hat is strapped around her neck and blowing behind her. This scene is flanked by two tattoo-covered women in white and gray (one striped, one with a fish-scale pattern) swimsuits riding sea horses and holding a tan banner that reads &quot;Lake Tahoe 1959&quot; over their heads with their free hands. The women have red bandanas around their necks, and the sea horses have red dorsal fins. A red banner that reads &quot;Queen of the Rodeo&quot; runs across the bottom of the mural. </description>

    <title>Unknown [Headquarters Bar Crawl Mural]</title>
    <creator>UTI Crew; Spek;</creator>
    <contributor>Art Spot Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>The theme of this vibrant mural, painted by members of UTI Crew during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, directly relates to the location in which it is painted: the wall of Headquarters Bar, a bar owned and operated by &quot;Crawl Reno, the organizers of the Reno Zombie Crawl and a ton of other massive parties in downtown Reno&quot; (http://headquartersreno.com/#home_about). On the right side of the mural stands a man with characteristics representative of the various crawls that take place in Reno throughout the year. The red Santa hat he wears with gold polka dots and a gold fur ball gestures towards the Santa Crawl; his green beard gestures towards the Leprechaun Crawl; and the Superman shirt he wears gestures towards the Super Hero Crawl. On the left side of the mural is a zombie with a mask resting on the top of its head, representing both the Zombie and Mardi Gras Crawls. These two figures flank four separate graffiti-style words (one of which appears to be the moniker of one of the UTI Crew members, Spek). In the background of the mural, a city skyline goes up in flames, perhaps caused by the man on the left who holds a lit match in his right hand, a mug of bear in his left. To the left of the mural is a small chain link fence with wood slats upon which &quot;The Crawl&quot; is painted in aqua, turquoise and sky blue horror font against a yellow and orange background with red splatters. </description>

    <date>2013</date>
    <description>This 65 x (roughly) 16 foot mural pinated on the wall of Peerless Cleaners by artist Erik Burke combines Reno history and Nevada mountain ranges. The mural is speckled with small symbols that depict prominent Reno figures, organizations, and locations in the business's and city's history. Some of these symbols are connected, like constellations, by a line that carries throughout the composition. The mountain-range landscape can also be interpreted as draped fabric, connecting the mural to the the business located in that building. The mural is painted in shades of red, orange, yellow, blue and white.</description>

    <description>In this mural, artist Anthony Ortega paints a bright owl with super powers roaming the night. The owl is painted in shades of pink, orange, purple, red, beige, and green; it is draped with a  blue cloak with geometric shapes. The owl has green light rays beaming from its eyes into the bottom right corner of the mural. The sky is painted in dark blues and black with swirling white clouds. The style of the mural pays homage to Japanese anime, referenced through the animated owl, it's wardrobe, it's &quot;super power,&quot; and the anime-style clouds. </description>

    <description>According to artist Joe C. Rock, his mural on the exterior wall of the Renaissance Reno Downtown Hotel &quot;depicts imagery of Reno and the greater-Nevada area. The octagon 'R' is from the second Reno arch that ran from 1963-1987 [and] the background is filled with sage, our state flower. The 'E' is filled with a mountain bluebird, our state bird. The 'N' is inside a silver state of Nevada with a portrait of Jesse Reno, our city's namesake. The 'O' is from the current Reno arch [and sits over] a heart, inside the 'O' is a landscape of Mt. Rose surrounded by a red rose. The piece is finished off with the words 'Home Means Nevada,' our state song&quot; (https://www.instagram.com/p/BUS8FaqDbF4/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=joecrock13).</description>

    <description>This mural is a three-part piece painted by artist Joe C. Rock. The fence (of three total) here depicts a hand-drawn rudimentary map representing Sparks, Reno, Virginia City and Carson City, Nevada. The sage brush that grows horizontally behind the map peaks through holes in the map and the golden-yellow banner from the Nevada state flag wraps around and through the entire seen. A monochromatic portrait of Kit Carson is painted on the-right side of the fence.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Colorful Wolf]</title>
    <creator>Vaka; Sarra;</creator>
    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2014</date>
    <description>The back side of Vaka and Sarra's signal-box mural features an off-center close up of a wolf's head and face. The wolf's fur is multicolored: muted shades of purple, yellow, green, blue, and orange. The wolf's eyes are a mint green, its nose is black and purple, and the whiskers on the right side of its face are green, those on the left are purple. Vaka's moniker and the pound sign are painted in white against a black backdrop in the lower-left corner of the box. The wolf likely relates to the signal box's proximity to the University of Nevada, Reno, whose mascot is the wolf.</description>

    <description>Erik Burke's mural consists of seven frames that are the shape of Nevada, each portraying different landscapes within the state. Burke utilized the natural color and texture of the brick wall upon which the mural is painted to depict a shadow or backdrop behind the frames, all of which appear against a green background that is lighter on the edges and gets darker towards the middle of the mural.</description>

    <description>This monochromatic mural set against a light blue background depicts a camera with a roll of film unraveling from its film compartment. On the unraveled film can be seen the undeveloped images that the camera has captured. A girl holds her dog; a man hangs out the driver-side window of a van and looks at the camera; a man kneels in front of his bicycle; two children ride their bicycles; a man looks to his left with a city street behind him; a man holds two bags (one in each hand) up in the air and smiles at the camera; a woman stands with her hands in her pockets and smiles at the camera; a young girl looks quizzically at the camera; a young man looks back at the camera from the driver-side window of his car; a man stands with his hands in his pockets in front of a light pole; a man with a thick mustache looks directly at the camera, a skull-like object is to the left of him; four children sit together on some steps; a young girl rides a rocking horse. The film roll ends, leading into an orange burst and then beam of light that perhaps represents the light needed to expose the film. The light beam is surrounded by black, blue, and gray clouds.   </description>

    <description>Bryce Chisholm's mural, painted during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October, 2017, features a a vibrant multicolored background. A young woman on the right and a wolf below her on the left have been painted over the background using a stencil (a technique the artist is known for) and black and white paint. Two thin lines with stars surrounding them encircled the woman. A thin white outline of the number 4 (for 4th Street, where the building upon which the mural resides), surrounded by a blue flourish pattern, are painted in the upper-left side of the mural. A aqua-blue houndstooth pattern has been painted, again with a stencil in the upper-right corner of the mural.</description>

    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock depicts a cartoon animal laying down. The body is distorted, which is best conveyed by its exposed rib cage, dog-like face, and rabbit-like ears. One leg is dismembered and an explosion of air comes out from it. The background contains several different objects and forms, such as flowers and geometric shapes, and it is painted with blue, red, and white.</description>

    <creator>Lucido, Michael</creator>
    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Michael Lucido's electric-box mural features two sunglass-wearing raccoons on the back. A raccoon holding a video camera in its right hand while flashing a &quot;sign of the horns&quot; gesture (the index finger and the little finger are upright and the thumb is clasped against the two middle fingers) on his left hand sits atop the shoulders of the other raccoon who is performing a kick flip on a sky-blue skateboard with pink wheels, the words &quot;Rad Thief&quot; (a reference to the name of Lucido's clothing company: Rad Thief) appear on the bottom of the board (&quot;Rad Thief&quot; also appears on the video camera). The raccoons are painted against a teal, yellow, and pink background. Three smaller boxes (one blue, one yellow, one pink) sit to the left of the main box. The panel of the box to the right is painted black with the words &quot;Reno Is Rad.&quot; All three words have a different appearance: &quot;Reno&quot; is all caps, painted in aqua-blue block letters with magenta shadows; &quot;Is&quot; appears in black caps against a bright yellow banner-like background; &quot;Rad&quot; is painted in white cursive letters, with a white underline. White eight-pointed stars speckle the panel. The  skateboarding theme of this box possibly relates to its location at City Park Plaza, used in the past as an unofficial skate park. The video camera might be symbolic Lucido's involvement with multi-media production.</description>

    <contributor>Blum Reno</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits. This portrait is of Mark Twain, who lived and wrote for a newspaper in Virginia City and Carson City, NV in the early 1860s. The top of his head is represented as an open book, and there is a quill pen over his right shoulder.</description>

    <description>At 28 x 140 ft., Erik Burke's mural, Camouflage, is the largest painted during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017. The mural abstracts images such as a pioneer woman riding a horse, cacti, and sheep that represent Nevada's historical past as well as its promising future. The top of the mural reads &quot;Look to the Pasture to see the Future,&quot; conveying the influence that the natural landscape, farming and ranching has had in this state. </description>

    <description>The mural on the left, painted by HS, combines graffiti with vibrant animation. Silly monkeys and a cockatoo perched on a branch flank the vibrant graffiti text that emerges from green leaves. The mural on the right, painted by members of UTI Crew, depicts imagery associated with heavy metal band Iron Maiden. The mummy, skeletons, graveyard, and ominous skylines can all be found on various album covers and merchandise. Various graffiti-style words (likely the artists' monikers) appear throughout the mural.</description>

    <description>This mural painted by artist Erik Burke is composed of two main subjects: a Reno landscape at sunset, and an electrocardiograph line running through the entire mural. The beloved mountains of Northern Nevada are depicted below in black as the blue and black clouds begin to take over the setting sun. The spots of white depicted throughout the black mountains depict life in the city. Life in Reno is further symbolized by the large and vibrant electrocardiograph line (or heartbeat line) painted across the landscape in green and white.</description>

    <creator>Burke, Erik; Burke, Erik (OverUnder);</creator>
    <contributor>Nevada Fine Arts</contributor>
    <date>2013</date>
    <description>Erik Burkes describes his mural, Rebuilding the Block, as &quot;a texture dense field of western motifs and a deconstructed cinder block. Atop the pattern sits yellow lines demarcating the layout of the streets, a mile in every direction. A pair of eyes represent the creative visionaries atop a city determined to reinvent itself without any luck or success. The nearby peak of Mt. Rose is anchored at the base of the wall, covering the mouth and serving as a reference point for Reno's most regarded resource...Lake Tahoe&quot; (eriktburke.com). A gray cinder block floats in front of a person's forehead that is framed by hair. Piercing blue eyes stare at the viewer as the facial features begin to fade at the bridge of the nose. Blue, green, and red triangles in ones, twos, and threes speckle the mural and comprise Lake Tahoe at the bottom of the mural, with Mt. Rose rising above. Faint yellow lines representing roads/streets cover the mural. Burke's moniker (OU34) is painted in bright yellow on the bottom-left corner. The mural is 16 x 20 ft.</description>

    <description>This gypsy-like woman, painted by artist Anthony Ortega, fashions a combination of deep-red and golden-yellow hair, wrapped in a green and white gypsy headscarf, embellished with a vibrant yellow flower. She is also accented with dangling golden earrings, blue sleeves, and detailed floral designs on her shoulders. She holds a cocktail in her left hand, displaying her connection to Davidson's distillery, the place upon which the mural was painted.</description>

    <description>This wall on the west side of the building occupied by Nevada Fine Arts contains six 16 x 20 ft. panels, each painted by a different artist. From left to right: Artist Joe C. Rock pays homage to the renowned artist, Georgia O'Keefe, through a surrealist-style head (that of O'Keefe, according to Rock) that explodes with ideas. The mountain on her right shoulder, as well as the hanging flower, refer to subjects in O'Keefe's own artworks. Rock adds a twist to the O'Keefe style by incorporating words in different font styles and vibrant colors such as pink, purple, green, and yellow.; Artist Nanook portrays hands emerging from a turquoise background balancing stones. A blue and green ikat patterned snake-like object winds through the mural, separating the turquoise background from the abstract blue sky above; Erik Burke describes his mural, Rebuilding the Block, as &quot;a texture dense field of western motifs and a deconstructed cinder block. Atop the pattern sits yellow lines demarcating the layout of the streets, a mile in every direction. A pair of eyes represent the creative visionaries atop a city determined to reinvent itself without any luck or success. The nearby peak of Mt. Rose is anchored at the base of the wall, covering the mouth and serving as a reference point for Reno's most regarded resource...Lake Tahoe&quot; (eriktburke.com). A gray cinder block floats in front of a person's forehead, framed by hair. Piercing blue eyes stare at the viewer as the facial features begin to fade at the bridge of the nose. Blue, green, and red triangles in ones, twos, and threes speckle the mural and comprise Lake Tahoe at the bottom of the mural, with Mt. Rose rising above. Faint yellow lines representing roads/streets cover the mural; A vibrant yellow, orange, and red coyote sitting in front of a bronze moon rising amid a monochromatic sky and a mountain range comprised of various shapes, patterns and objects is the focal point of this mural painted by Kelly Peyton. Hearts, lighting bolts, fish skeletons and some words disguise themselves in the coyote's fur; A monochromatic mural painted by artist Fitz portrays a long-haired girl opening a window or roller door to reveal the only polychromatic portion of the mural, an outdoor scene of a lake, mountains and flowers. This scene is flanked on the right by industrial imagery, such as gears and conveyor belts; Artist Bryce Chisholm painted a &quot;Super Boy&quot; on his panel using a stencil (a technique Chisholm is known for). Outfitted in a red and black cape and mask with a star emblazoned on his chest, the boy strikes a heroic pose against a colorful background of various geometric shapes and patterns. Flying pigeons speckle the mural, while one is perched in the upper-left corner.</description>

    <description>&quot;DAYDREAM!&quot; appears in all caps in this mural that artist Joe C. Rock painted on a chain link fence with wood slats. Enclosed within the block letters is green grass against a blue skyline. The letters are outlined in white and cast red shadows outlined in peach. Growing out of the grass in the first &quot;D&quot; is a blue flower. A butterfly with blue wings perches on the outside edge of the second &quot;D&quot; and a lady bug crawls across the grass. A red rose rests on the left side of the &quot;R.&quot; A worm slithers through the grass, straddling the right side of the &quot;R&quot; and left side of the &quot;E,&quot; disappearing and re-emerging out of the right side of the &quot;E.&quot; A blue flower with a lady bug on it grows out of the grass in the dot of the exclamation point. </description>

    <creator>Nanook; Burke, Erik; Burke, Erik (OverUnder);</creator>
    <contributor>Craft Wine and Beer; NA;</contributor>
    <date>2013</date>
    <description>Artists Nanook and Erik Burke painted these two adjacent walls on the back and side of Craft Wine and Beer. On the southern wall, Nanook paints a bull with rooster-patterned fur against a white background with a dark aegean-blue border at the bottom. Three large black circles with mustard-yellow outlines and flowers with dark-red centers speckle the mural and one large red circle appears in the center of the mural. A prominent cerulean-blue curvy line with a lighter and thinner line next to it horizontally spans the mural, weaving through and around the circles and bull. In the bottom left corner of the mural, Nanook's moniker and the date have been painted in the same blue as the curvy line against the dark aegean-blue border. On the eastern wall, Artist Erik Burke painted this beer-and-wine themed, 45 x 18 foot mural to coincide with the business upon which it resides. Dark brown beer bottles and green and pink wine bottles, all with various labels, are painted against a cerulean-blue background. The bottles are painted in a repeating pattern wherein either: one bottle faces right-way up while another is turned upside down with a stream of beer or wine flowing between the mouths of the bottles; or, one bottle faces right-way up while the other is turned upside and the bases of bottles rest on each other. The largest bottle and focal point of the mural is a beer bottle with a monochromatic label depicting a hops farmer and that reads &quot;Craft Wine Beer.&quot;</description>

    <date>2016</date>
    <description>This mural depicts a trout with vibrantly colored, checkered skin. Among the various patterns in its checkered skin are cherries, PacMan ghosts, chains, peacock feathers, roses, polka dots, and botehs (the teardrop-shaped motif with a curved upper end that comprises the paisley pattern). Below the fish is the message &quot;Lahontan Cutthroat Trout Back From Extinction!&quot; A bee (not visible) hovers behind the trout, holding in its legs a sewing needle through which a piece of pink thread attached to the caudal peduncle of the fish is threaded. To the right of the bee (also not visible) are the words &quot;One Love&quot; and the artist's moniker (Mafat) and date.</description>

    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>As artist Joe C. Rock explains on his website: &quot;This mural was created as an ode to the history of the Midtown area in Reno, NV.  The word 'Midtown' covers the wall in painted exposed brick, transitioning from new, to worn down, to built back up with metal and brackets, just as the area has [b]een throughout the years. Vintage ads and photographs of [influential] people and businesses, [as well as] imagery that helped build up the area are recreated in spray paint and house paint [and] collaged about in a makeshift timeline of the area [that leads] up to a motel sign from the street, re-lettered to say 'look to the future.' A child adorned in an American-flag dress with Lady Liberty's crown, torch, and tablets looks blindly into the future.&quot;</description>

    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2013</date>
    <description>This mural painted by artist Erik Burke embraces the history of Nevada. Similar to his other murals, this work is composed of two main elements: a landscape, and the words &quot;GO WEST.&quot; The landscape depicts the variety of mountain ranges in Nevada, suggested by the variety of color (shades of red and blue) in which they are painted. The landscape also portrays a wild mustang, an animal representative of the &quot;wild west&quot; nature of Nevada. On the right side of the mural appears a female figure holding a lantern, as if guiding the horse and throwing into relief the words &quot;GO WEST.&quot; The words are painted in a subtle yellow and white that merges them into the landscape. The lines in between the words, which depict birch trees with Basque tree carvings that are found in the state, weave in front of and behind the mustang and run parallel (and in some cases line up directly with) the building behind the mural (the Silver Legacy Hotel &amp; Casino), further connecting the mural to the city.</description>

    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>The theme of this electric box is directly related to and represents its location in front of the Lear Theater in Reno, NV. Artist Bryce Chisholm painted a rendering of the theater using black and white paint and a stencil, a technique he is known for. The theater's roof line and columns are outlined in a bright-light blue, and bright yellow was used to paint the lights hanging from the ceiling above the entryway. In the upper-left corner of the box, Chisholm created the illusion of sun rays behind the theater using yellow and deep-orange paint, while a tranquil, watercolor-esque blue sky with hints of yellow appears behind the theater in the upper-right corner. Stencils were again used to paint the damask patterns that appear in teal under the sun rays on the left side of the box and the larger purple ones on the right side. White and yellow paint stream down from the upper-left corner of the box, while white, green and blue paint streams down from the upper-left corner. Chisholm's mo</description>

    <creator>Rock, Joe C.</creator>
    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>The theme of the mural on this detached garage, painted by Joe C. Rock, relates to its location behind Marmot Properties, one of the foremost real estate development companies in Reno, particularly active in the Midtown area. The entire structure is painted bright green. On the front of the garage is the head of a person with their hair covering their face, their right hand cups the lower part of their face. Reno's downtown skyline comprises the top of the head with Mount Rose at its apex. A red and gold crown (a common object in Rock's murals) with a halo of barbed wire floats above the head. On the garage door, the words &quot;The Heart of the City&quot;(with a heart above the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;city&quot;) are painted over the head in red with a neon-green outline. Pink hearts appear on the portion of the letters that extend past the head, and the portion covering the head is transparent, revealing imagery behind it. The door is framed by branches of sagebrush and the shadows they cast. &quot;The Heart of the City&quot; might symbolize the centrality of the Midtown district in the greater Reno area, both geographically and culturally.</description>

    <contributor>Art Spot Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Five panels of this wall were painted by five different artists during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017. The two here were painted by artists Ahren Hertel and Joe C. Rock. Hertel paints this blue jay in the desert perched atop a cow skull with a stalk of wheat clasped in its beak. Smoke billows behind the bird from a fire burning off in the distance. The plumage on the bird's head and part of the wheat stalk extend past the arched boundary of the mural and into the natural wall upon which the mural is painted; Rock depicts a cowboy riding a wild mustang into the sunset, representative of the Reno Rodeo. A halo of barbed wire floats above the cowboy's hat and a locomotive disguises itself in the body of the mustang. The background is painted bright blue with a beige banner swirling across it that reads &quot;Get Buck Get Broke.&quot; Objects, such as grape bundles, crowns (a common object in Rock's murals), hearts and cherries speckle the mural's background.</description>

    <title>Nevada; Nevada Row</title>
    <creator>Burke, Erik; Burke, Erik (OverUnder); Rock, Joe C.</creator>
    <contributor>Blum Reno</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits, spanning the entire 250 x 20 foot mural. The portraits, from left to right, are as follows: Frederic DeLongchamps, one of Nevada's most prolific architects; Dot So La Lee, a basket weaver and member of the northwestern Nevada Washoe; Wovoka, a Paiute religious leader; Ben Palmer, one of the original settlers of and most successful ranchers in the Carson Valley; Michael Heizer, a contemporary artist whose life-long project, City, is &quot;the largest piece of contemporary art ever attempted&quot; (http://doublenegative.tarasen.net/city/)&quot;; Jeanne Wier, founder of the Nevada Historical Society; Abraham Lincoln, whose re-election in 1864 was largely due to Nevada's expedited entry into statehood; Jack Johnson, who, after winning a bout against James Jeffries in Reno, NV in 1910, became the first African American world heavyweight boxing champion; Sarah Winnemucca, a Northern Paiute activist from Nevada; and Mark Twain, who lived and wrote for a newspaper in Virginia City and Carson City, NV in the early 1860s. Each portrait contains a detail pertaining to the individual, for example: buildings on top of DeLonghamps' head; a basket behind the top of Dot So La Lee's head; a brand surrounded by barbed wire on top of Palmer's head; Heizer wears a hat that appears sculpted from metal to symbolize his work as a sculptor; a rendering of the Nevada Historical Society in the broach pinned to Weir's collar; the US Highway sign imposed on Lincoln's head is symbolic of his namesake, US Route 40; a rendering of Johnson knocking Jeffries out during the championship bout; and the top of Twain's head represented as an open book, and a quill pen over his right shoulder. </description>

    <description>This signal box was painted by artist Michael Lucido to look like it has been boarded up and turned into a raccoon fort, as the mural's title suggests. On the front side of the box, a wide-eyed raccoon with its mouth wide open peaks out through an opening between the boards, a bare fish skeleton dangles from its left paw, its tail pokes out through a hole in a board. The words &quot;Raccoons Only&quot; appear in red below the raccoon, and Lucido's last name, website (www.thatlucidokid.com) and the date are painted in black at the very bottom of the box.</description>

    <description>The eastern wall of the Circus Circus Reno contains seven 20 x 14 ft. panels, each painted by a different artist during the 2017 24-Hour Mural Marathon competition. From left to right: Anthony Ortega won the competition with a psychedelic mural composition that combines ancient Mesoamerican art with futuristic elements. This mural is painted with vibrant shades of blue, red, green, orange, yellow, pink, and purple, portraying a vivid ancient Mesoamerican god-like figure that emerges from the stellar depths of the galaxy behind it and begins it descent into the green forest that surrounds the outer edges of the mural; Kendel Leslie painted a colorful mural with a blue humpback whale as the primary subject. The whale is painted in several shades of blue and purple. The background is composed of different shapes and formed in light pink, magenta, lime green, pastel yellow and purple among a black background with white stars, alluding to a galaxy-like ocean; Artist Raphael Blanco's mural depicts a child taking a photograph using a vintage camera. Although the child is painted predominantly with black, Blanco also uses the colors of the background (blue and purple) for the child's skin color and to create highlights in his/her hair. The background is composed of stripes in an array of shades of blue and purple. There are also translucent white splashes &quot;splattered&quot; around the child; Seth McCorkle depicted a boy with a pointed hat looking ahead. Behind, there is a landscape scene composed of brown hills and bright blue skies; Hannah Sproul painted a turquoise skeleton with a burning cigarette clenched in its teeth against a periwinkle blue background. Flowers in an array of sizes and colors ( blue, yellow, pink, and white) emerge from the bottom of the mural, surrounding the skeleton. Large strips of paint (light pink, yellow, magenta, sky blue, and pastel orange) drip down from the top of the mural; Stephane Cellier depicted a man with a a sword. He stands among mist with a grey background behind; Marv Riley depicted the head of a ferocious tiger with an ornate frame surrounding it over a maroon background.   </description>

    <contributor>Blum Reno</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits. The portraits is of Jack Johnson who, after winning a bout against James Jeffries in Reno, NV in 1910, became the first African American world heavyweight boxing champion. Above his head is a rendering of Johnson knocking Jeffries out during the championship bout.</description>

    <creator>Children's Cabinet: &quot;Spray Positive&quot; (Collective)</creator>
    <contributor>Children's Cabinet; Reno Police Department;</contributor>
    <date>2017;</date>
    <description>The mural on the two adjacent back walls of Mountain Music Parlor was painted by a group of youth who are part of the Children's Cabinet's &quot;Spray Positive&quot; program. This program was instigated by the Reno Police Department, in collaboration with the Children's Cabinet, as a way to beautify blighted properties in Midtown and Downtown Reno. A dream catcher with music notes in the web leads to the head of a Native-American figure wearing an elaborate headdress. An American flag emerges from the left side of the headdress and straddles both walls. A portrait of a man in a cowboy hat (most likely bluegrass musician Bill Monroe) painted in front of the flag graces the adjacent wall, and the mural concludes with a rendering of a chick playing a cello with the name &quot;Bill Monroe&quot; painted above it.</description>

    <description>Artists Troy Lovegates, Collin van der Sluijis and Joe C. Rock painted adjacent walls at the top of this building during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017. The collaborative mural painted by Troy Lovegates and Collin van der Sluijis on the left portrays several symbols of Nevada's history, landscape, wildlife and fauna. A mountain bluebird is flanked on the left by the upper body of a monochromatic Native American man and on the right by Canadian Geese flying in front of the lower body of a cowboy-boot-wearing individual. The mural is further embellished with feathers, various flowers, pyramids, and red and yellow polka dots. As artist Joe C. Rock explains, his mural on the right &quot;featur[es] the arm of my mother stretched across 2nd St... representing her strength and commitment to diversity with her 65 year old freshly tattooed arm piece...I was raised by my mother my entire childhood in a single parent home, she did everything she could do to get me to make the right choices in life and did whatever she needed to do to provide the best life for my cousins, sister and myself, sacrificing her own needs for ours&quot; (https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb-uzY6Dwyr/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=joecrock13) &amp; (&amp;lt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BeL5LzdDuCN/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=joecrock13&amp;gt;). </description>

    <description>At 28 x 140 ft., Erik Burke's mural, Camouflage, is the largest painted during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017. The mural abstracts images such as a pioneer woman on riding a horse, cacti, and sheep that represent Nevada's historical past as well as its promising future. The top of the mural reads &quot;Look to the Pasture to see the Future,&quot; conveying the influence that the natural landscape, farming and ranching has had in this state.</description>

    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>A red classic car with a white roof wraps around the front and right side of Vaka's signal-box mural. Yellow and light-purple hand prints adorn the grill of the car and yellow, light-purple and light-blue hand prints appear below the bumper. A black mountainous skyline with a pink &quot;Reno&quot; painted over it in pink is depicted in the car's license plate. Vaka's moniker is painted on the top of the right side in purple and white. The content and theme of the mural (the classic car and Monroe eating a burger) relates to the location in which the signal box resides: in front of Juicy's Giant Hamburgers, a popular restaurant in Reno with the feel of an old-fashioned burger joint.</description>

    <description>Deep-orange lilies, painted by Random Act, flank the Buddha-like figure with three eyes, the middle of which has green and magenta rays beaming from it towards the sky that was painted by Garrison Buxton. A rainbow of colors emerge from the figure's mouth, eventually casting an orange and lavender background upon which the phrase &quot;Thoughts Are Things&quot; is painted in white. The yin-and-yang symbol hangs on a green necklace around the figure's neck, below which the phrase &quot;Know Thy Self&quot; appears on a banner across the figure's torso. To the right of the figure, the phrase &quot;Be Kind&quot; is painted in white against a periwinkle background. Buxton's moniker is painted in metallic gold on the bottom-right corner of the mural.</description>

    <description>In this mural painted by artists Yale Wolf and Tipton Power during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, a dark night sky with yellow stars swirls behind a teal blue classic Cadillac with a white roof that drives, or rather, flies, over a tumultuous sea. The front license plate of the Cadillac reads &quot;LOWFLY&quot; and the rear plate reads &quot;B4L8R&quot; (suggesting there might actually be two separate cars). The mural inside the garage below was painted by a different artist at a different time.</description>

    <description>This monochromatic mural set against a light blue background depicts a camera with a roll of film unraveling from its film compartment. On the unraveled film can be seen the undeveloped images that the camera has captured. A girl holds her dog; a man hangs out the driver-side window of a van and looks at the camera; a man kneels in front of his bicycle; two children ride their bicycles; a man looks to his left with a city street behind him; a man holds two bags (one in each hand) up in the air and smiles at the camera; a woman stands with her hands in her pockets and smiles at the camera; a young girl looks quizzically at the camera; a young man looks back at the camera from the driver-side window of his car; a man stands with his hands in his pockets in front of a light pole; a man with a thick mustache looks directly at the camera, a skull-like object is to the left of him; four children sit together on some steps; a young girl rides a rocking horse. The film roll ends, leading into an orange burst and then beam of light that perhaps represents the light needed to expose the film. The light beam is surrounded by black, blue, and gray clouds.   </description>

    <description>This mural depicts inebriated individuals floating on the surface of a red sea, flanked by the Roman god of the sea, Neptune, and the Roman god of agriculture, wine and fertility, Bacchus. Lighting bolts strike the red water from an ominous cloudy sky above. On the left of this scene, the words &quot;Craft Wine -n-Beer&quot; are painted vertically, and in the lower-right corner of the mural, against the red-sea background, the quote &quot;Bacchus Hath Drowned more Men than Neptune. -Dr. Thomas Fuller&quot; is etched on a placard flanked by roses.  The entire mural is monochromatic, with the exception of the red sea.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Headquarters Bar Crawl Mural]</title>
    <creator>UTI Crew; Spek;</creator>
    <contributor>Art Spot Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>The theme of this vibrant mural, painted by members of UTI Crew during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, directly relates to the location in which it is painted: the wall of Headquarters Bar, a bar owned and operated by &quot;Crawl Reno, the organizers of the Reno Zombie Crawl and a ton of other massive parties in downtown Reno&quot; (http://headquartersreno.com/#home_about). On the right side of the mural stands a man with characteristics representative of the various crawls that take place in Reno throughout the year. The red Santa hat he wears with gold polka dots and a gold fur ball gestures towards the Santa Crawl; his green beard gestures towards the Leprechaun Crawl; and the Superman shirt he wears gestures towards the Super Hero Crawl. On the left side of the mural is a zombie with a mask resting on the top of its head, representing both the Zombie and Mardi Gras Crawls. These two figures flank four separate graffiti-style words (one of which appears to be the moniker of one of the UTI Crew members, Spek). In the background of the mural, a city skyline goes up in flames, perhaps caused by the man on the left who holds a lit match in his right hand, a mug of bear in his left. To the left of the mural is a small chain link fence with wood slats upon which &quot;The Crawl&quot; is painted in aqua, turquoise and sky blue horror font against a yellow and orange background with red splatters. </description>

    <date>2016</date>
    <description>As artist Joe C. Rock explains on his website: &quot;This mural was created as an ode to the history of the Midtown area in Reno, NV.  The word 'Midtown' covers the wall in painted exposed brick, transitioning from new, to worn down, to built back up with metal and brackets, just as the area has [b]een throughout the years. Vintage ads and photographs of [influential] people and businesses, [as well as] imagery that helped build up the area are recreated in spray paint and house paint [and] collaged about in a makeshift timeline of the area [that leads] up to a motel sign from the street, re-lettered to say 'look to the future.' A child adorned in an American-flag dress with Lady Liberty's crown, torch, and tablets looks blindly into the future.&quot;</description>

    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>This mural depicts a trout with vibrantly colored, checkered skin. Among the various patterns in its checkered skin are cherries, PacMan ghosts, chains, peacock feathers, roses, polka dots, and botehs (the teardrop-shaped motif with a curved upper end that comprises the paisley pattern). Below the fish is the message &quot;Lahontan Cutthroat Trout Back From Extinction!&quot; A bee hovers behind the trout, holding in its legs a sewing needle through which a piece of pink thread attached to the caudal peduncle of the fish is threaded. To the right of the bee are the words &quot;One Love&quot; and the artist's moniker (Mafat) and date.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Octopus, Peacock Feathers, Futuristic Head]</title>
    <creator>Pittman, Adam (Naem); Pittman, Adam;</creator>
    <contributor>The Melting Pot World Emporium &amp; Smoke Shop</contributor>
    <date>2015</date>
    <description>This mural depicts a large brown octopus mixed with peacock feathers and a human-like figure. The octopus is the focus of the mural. The body of the octopus is painted in a palette of browns, while its suckers are painted in a palette of blue. The peacock feathers almost resemble the suckers as they intertwine into the octopus's tentacles. The tentacles wrap around and burst through a portrait of a blue human-like figure wearing headphones that emerges from the mud-cracked ground, perhaps representing Burning Man since the business upon which the mural is painted, The Melting Pot World Emporium, is one of the leading retailers of Playa gear in the area. The figure stares out into the distance. A tentacle bursts through the middle portrait, which depicts the Burning Man logo centered in the Burning-Man-Playa landscape with planets hanging in the night sky above. The last portrait is a circus-style wall sign for the The Melting Pot. A curtain opens up to a stage with silhouettes of people dancing in front of an earth with sun rays around it. The background of the entire mural is painted a bright red, contrasting the aquatic and desert ambiance of the subject matter. </description>

    <contributor>Blum Reno</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com).A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits. This portrait is of Mark Twain, who lived and wrote for a newspaper in Virginia City and Carson City, NV in the early 1860s. Here the top of his head is represented as an open book, and there is a quill pen over his right shoulder.</description>

A blue and green ikat patterned snake-like object winds through the mural, separating the turquoise background from the abstract blue sky above; Erik Burke describes his mural, Rebuilding the Block, as &quot;a texture dense field of western motifs and a deconstructed cinder block. Atop the pattern sits yellow lines demarcating the layout of the streets, a mile in every direction. A pair of eyes represent the creative visionaries atop a city determined to reinvent itself without any luck or success. The nearby peak of Mt. Rose is anchored at the base of the wall, covering the mouth and serving as a reference point for Reno's most regarded resource...Lake Tahoe&quot; (eriktburke.com). A gray cinder block floats in front of a person's forehead, framed by hair. Piercing blue eyes stare at the viewer as the facial features begin to fade at the bridge of the nose. Blue, green, and red triangles in ones, twos, and threes speckle the mural and comprise Lake Tahoe at the bottom of the mural, with Mt. Rose rising above. Faint yellow lines representing roads/streets cover the mural; A vibrant yellow, orange, and red coyote sitting in front of a bronze moon rising amid a monochromatic sky and a mountain range comprised of various shapes, patterns and objects is the focal point of this mural painted by Kelly Peyton. Hearts, lighting bolts, fish skeletons and some words disguise themselves in the coyote's fur; A monochromatic mural painted by artist Fitz portrays a long-haired girl opening a window or roller door to reveal the only polychromatic portion of the mural, an outdoor scene of a lake, mountains and flowers. This scene is flanked on the right by industrial imagery, such as gears and conveyor belts; Artist Bryce Chisholm painted a &quot;Super Boy&quot; on his panel using a stencil (a technique Chisholm is known for). Outfitted in a red and black cape and mask with a star emblazoned on his chest, the boy strikes a heroic pose against a colorful background of various geometric shapes and patterns. Flying pigeons speckle the mural, while one is perched in the upper-left corner.    </description>

    <description>This mural is a three-part piece painted by artist Joe C. Rock. The two fences here (of three total) converge into a nautical star with monochromatic portraits of Jesse Lee Reno to the left and John Sparks to the right. Sage brush grows horizontally from each man's face. On the left (Reno) side of the fence, Nevada's nickname/slogan &quot;Battle Born&quot; is painted in black along the length of the fence, against a rich blue background. A mountain bluebird perches on the sagebrush in front of the &quot;B&quot; in &quot;Born.&quot; The golden-yellow banner from the Nevada state flag wraps around flows through the entire scene.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Angel of Reno]; Unknown [Nature]</title>
    <creator>Angelina, Christina; Gordon, Ricky Lee;</creator>
    <contributor>Shapiro, Aric; Burke, Erik; Art Spot Reno; Whitney Peak Hotel;</contributor>
    <date>2015; 2017;</date>
    <description>Christina Angelina's mural, painted during the Inaugural Reno Sculpture Fest in 2015, features a young female figure wearing a dark grey hood over her long wavy black hair. She looks directly at the viewer, and holds a silver frame against her body. The mural was painted using a palette of blues, grays, silver and black and using a technique wherein the paint streams down from the very top of the mural to create movement in the composition. Due to the mural's considerably large scale (approximately 35 x 80 ft.), spanning the entire height of a seven-story parking garage, the young woman seems to look down upon or watch over the downtown-Reno area. After being told by a homeless man in Reno that the young woman is his angel, Angelina said: &quot;That people sleep under this artwork to feel safer downtown [m]akes me like this piece even more&quot; (https://www.instagram.com/p/BUx2SQUlhIj/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=starfightera). The mural on the right was painted by artist Ricky Lee Gordon during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017. Gordon painted a female figure with the word &quot;nature&quot; hovering over her. Gordon uses dark colors to obscure the woman's face. The woman represents the Native American community in northern Nevada and the importance of conserving nature. A messages in the lower-right corner of the mural reads &quot;Nature Conspires with Spirit to Emancipate Us.&quot;</description>

    <description>This mural, painted as a tribute to September 11, 2001, contains classic patriotic-American imagery. On the left side of the mural, a bald eagle appears behind the word &quot;September&quot; that is painted in blue block letters with &quot;9/11,&quot;&quot;2001,&quot; and &quot;2011&quot; painted within them. To the right of this are the silhouettes of what appear to be construction workers raising the American flag. Next, a rendering of the New York City skyline appears. The sun glows bright yellow behind both the flag-raising construction workers and the skyline. Last, the Statue of Liberty's head and her torch are depicted in profile.</description>

    <date>2013</date>
    <description>This 65 x (roughly) 16 foot mural pinated on the wall of Peerless Cleaners by artist Erik Burke combines Reno history and Nevada mountain ranges. The mural is speckled with small symbols that depict prominent Reno figures, organizations, and locations in the business's and city's history. Some of these symbols are connected, like constellations, by a line that carries throughout the composition. The mountain-range landscape can also be interpreted as draped fabric, connecting the mural to the the business located in that building. The mural is painted in shades of red, orange, yellow, blue and white.</description>

    <contributor>Blum Reno</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits. This portrait is of Abraham Lincoln, whose re-election in 1864 was largely due to Nevada's expedited entry into statehood. The US Highway sign imposed on Lincoln's head is symbolic of his namesake, US Route 40.</description>

    <title>No Evil</title>

    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>Each of these three garage doors, painted by artist Joe C. Rock, contains one of the three components that make up the proverbial principle: speak no evil, hear no evil, see no evil. The principle is phrased on the doors as &quot;Speak, Hear, &amp; See.&quot; On the first door, a man covers his mouth with his right hand, a letter of the word &quot;LOVE&quot; is tattooed on each finger. A lady bug rests on the base of his thumb. A red banner outlined in gold with the word &quot;Speak&quot; painted in white covers his eyes. On the second door, a man covers both his hears with his hands. A black widow crawls downward in front of his left hand. The word &quot;Hear&quot; appears in white on the red banner that wraps around his head, covering both of his ears. On the third garage, a man covers his eyes with his left hand. A worm on a hook attached to a line that carries through the entire mural is laced through his fingers, each of which have a letter of the word &quot;Hate&quot; tattooed on them. The words &quot;&amp; See&quot; are painted in white on the red banner that covers the man's mouth. A bee with a crown (a common object in Rock's murals) floating above its head flies in the upper-left corner of the third door.</description>

    <date>2014</date>
    <description>This signal box was painted by artist Michael Lucido to look like it has been boarded up and turned into a raccoon fort, as the mural's title suggests. On the right side of the box, a wide-eyed raccoon with its mouth wide open stands outside the fort with a Campbell's Tomato Soup can in its left paw and a paint brush in its right paw. Red tomato soup is on the tip of the brush, as well as on the raccoon's tongue and around its mouth. The words &quot;Rad City&quot; are painted in red on a board above the raccoon's head. The back side of the box depicts a ladder leading into the fort and the artist's last name (Lucido) painted in bright green appears all over the boards.</description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>The back side of Ashley Follmer's signal-box mural depicts a figure wearing a black suit, white-collared shirt and magenta neck tie. The figure stands with hands in pockets and the section of the figure where the neck and head should be erupts into a huge cloud that transitions from dark blue on the left, to light blue, to white, to pink, to magenta on the right. This figure is painted against a background that transitions from bright yellow at the top to deep orange at the bottom. The subject of this mural might relate to its location on the University of Nevada, Reno campus: perhaps the figure's head is exploding from the knowledge it has acquired (as in, &quot;mind blown!&quot;).</description>

    <description>The focal point of artist Seth McCorkle's signal-box mural is the mountain chickadee, common in the mountains of Nevada. On the back side of the box, a single dickadee is perched on a branch of a plant or tree, with a little green foliage on it. A cerulean-blue body of water appears in the background, with a light blue sky with fluffy-white clouds above. McCorkle's moniker and the date are painted in light blue on the bottom-left corner of the box.</description>

    <description>The face depicted in this mural by artist Bryce Chisholm was painted using a stencil (a technique the artist is known for) and purple, magenta, salmon, green, aqua-blue and dark-blue paint. Mint-green rays of light with birds flying through and beyond them shine down behind the face. Various-sized blue stars outlined in gold speckle the mural, starting at the left cheek of the face and spanning the remainder of mural to the right. To the right of the face, a black and white cheetah sits atop a light-purple hill with delicate plants growing from it. Three large circles comprised of small individual concentric white, blue, and gold brush strokes appear behind and to the left of the face, in the middle of the wall; to the right of the face, between the hair and light rays, towards the bottom of the wall; and to the right of cheetah, towards the middle of the wall. Chisholm's moniker (ABC Art Attack) and the date are painted in white with blue outline at the top of the right side of the mural.</description>

    <creator>Burke, Erik; Burke, Erik (OverUnder);</creator>
    <contributor>The Hudson Project</contributor>
    <date>2013</date>
    <description>According to artist Erik Burke who painted this 18 x 50 foot mural, &quot;The Hudson Project is a block of mixed-use urban infill development between Center and Lake Street on State Street. The mural graces the east side of the development and is a visualization of all the people and business that inhabited this block dating back to 1890&quot; (http://eriktburke.com/Hudson-Project). The upper portion of the left side of the mural is composed of various vibrant shades of green while the bottom portion depicting a landscape is composed of a vibrant blue, brown/tan, yellow, and more green. The right side of the mural is a wheat pasted silhouette profile of a man conducting a land survey against a large white circle (perhaps representing the moon). This technique creates a life-like, almost 3D depiction of the man, the colors of which tie in with the left portion of the mural. </description>

    <contributor>Becerra, Manny;</contributor>
    <date>2013</date>
    <description>This 65 x (roughly) 16 foot mural pinated on the wall of Peerless Cleaners by artist Erik Burke combines Reno history and Nevada mountain ranges. The mural is speckled with small symbols that depict prominent Reno figures, organizations, and locations in the business's and city's history. Some of these symbols are connected, like constellations, by a line that carries throughout the composition. The mountain-range landscape can also be interpreted as draped fabric, connecting the mural to the the business located in that building. The mural is painted in shades of red, orange, yellow, blue and white.</description>

    <date>2013</date>
    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock pays homage to the renowned artist, Georgia O'Keefe, through a surrealist-style head (that of O'Keefe, according to Rock) that explodes with ideas. The mountain on her left shoulder, as well as the hanging flower, refer subjects in O'Keefe's own artworks. Rock adds a twist to the O'Keefe style by incorporating words in different font styles and vibrant colors such as pink, purple, green, and yellow.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Angel of Reno]</title>
    <creator>Christina, Angelina</creator>
    <contributor>Burke, Erik; Shapiro, Aric; Whitney Peak Hotel;</contributor>
    <date>2015</date>
    <description>Christina Angelina's mural, painted during the Inaugural Reno Sculpture Fest in 2015, features a young female figure wearing a dark grey hood over her long wavy black hair. She looks directly at the viewer, and holds a silver frame against her body. The mural was painted using a palette of blues, grays, silver and black and using a technique wherein the paint streams down from the very top of the mural to create movement in the composition. Due to the mural's considerably large scale (approximately 35 x 80 ft.), spanning the entire height of a seven-story parking garage, the young woman seems to look down upon or watch over the downtown-Reno area. After being told by a homeless man in Reno that the young woman is his angel, Angelina said: &quot;That people sleep under this artwork to feel safer downtown [m]akes me like this piece even more&quot; (https://www.instagram.com/p/BUx2SQUlhIj/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=starfightera).</description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Artist Stephane Cellier used the natural angles of the wall upon which he painted this monochromatic mural during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017 to create an optical illusion. An &quot;x&quot; accompanied by &quot;please stand here to view the mural&quot; is painted on the the ground, marking the &quot;sweet spot&quot; from where the intended depiction of the mural can be correctly and fully observed: a man receiving a kiss on the cheek from a woman with words above that read &quot;Two Smiles Getting Closer End Up Making...A Kiss.&quot; Viewed head-on, the mural is a distorted mess.</description>

    <date>2016</date>
    <description>As artist Joe C. Rock explains on his website: &quot;This mural was created as an ode to the history of the Midtown area in Reno, NV.  The word 'Midtown' covers the wall in painted exposed brick, transitioning from new, to worn down, to built back up with metal and brackets, just as the area has [b]een throughout the years. Vintage ads and photographs of [influential] people and businesses, [as well as] imagery that helped build up the area are recreated in spray paint and house paint [and] collaged about in a makeshift timeline of the area [that leads] up to a motel sign from the street, re-lettered to say 'look to the future.' A child adorned in an American-flag dress with Lady Liberty's crown, torch, and tablets looks blindly into the future.&quot;</description>

    <description>Kendel Leslie's signal-box mural is dedicated to the preservation of Nevada's wilderness and wildlife. On the front side of the box, a coyote and pronghorn antelope are painted in the foreground. A red cactus pear grows in front of the coyote, and dessert or mountain grass grows in front of the antelope. Behind the the animals are the rolling brown hills of the Nevada dessert, behind which are the snow-capped Sierras. The sky is speckled with puffy white clouds. Leslie's moniker is painted in tiny-black letters in the bottom left corner of the box.</description>

    <description>Anthony Ortega won the 2017 24-Hour Mural Marathon competition with a psychedelic mural composition that combines ancient Mesoamerican art with futuristic elements. This mural is painted with vibrant shades of blue, red, green, orange, yellow, pink, and purple, portraying a vivid ancient Mesoamerican god-like figure that emerges from the stellar depths of the galaxy behind it and begins its descent into the green forest that surrounds the outer edges of the mural.</description>

    <description>During the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, artist Ricky Lee Gordon painted a female figure with the word &quot;NATURE&quot; hovering over her. Gordon uses dark colors to obscure the woman's face. The woman represents the Native American community in northern Nevada and the importance of conserving nature. A message in the lower-right corner of the mural reads &quot;Nature Conspires with Spirit to Emancipate Us.&quot;</description>

    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits. This portrait is of Dot So La Lee, a basket weaver and member of the northwestern Nevada Washoe, explaining the basket behind the top of her head.</description>

    <description>This mural painted by artist Joshua Coffy during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017 features a black bear with ryukin fish swimming around it. The bottom third of the mural's background is an aegean-blue color, perhaps representative of water, while the rest of the background is tan with chiffon circles (or bubbles). A grid of eleven colors has been painted in the top middle of the mural.</description>

    <date>2014</date>
    <description>The upper portion of the profile of a wolf howling against a blue, green and white background appears on the left side of Vaka and Sarra's signal-box mural. The wolf's fur is multicolored: shades of purple, yellow, green, blue, and orange. The colors on this side of the box are a bit more vibrant than those on the other sides. Sarra's moniker is painted in tan against a black back drop in the upper-left corner of the box. The wolf likely relates to the signal box's proximity to the University of Nevada, Reno, whose mascot is the wolf.</description>

    <title>Nevada; Nevada Row</title>

    <contributor>Blum Reno</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits, spanning the entire 250 x 20 foot mural. The portraits, from left to right, are as follows: Frederic DeLongchamps, one of Nevada's most prolific architects; Dot So La Lee, a basket weaver and member of the northwestern Nevada Washoe; Wovoka, a Paiute religious leader; Ben Palmer, one of the original settlers of and most successful ranchers in the Carson Valley; Michael Heizer, a contemporary artist whose life-long project, City, is &quot;the largest piece of contemporary art ever attempted&quot; (http://doublenegative.tarasen.net/city/)&quot;; Jeanne Wier, founder of the Nevada Historical Society; Abraham Lincoln, whose re-election in 1864 was largely due to Nevada's expedited entry into statehood; Jack Johnson, who, after winning a bout against James Jeffries in Reno, NV in 1910, became the first African American world heavyweight boxing champion; Sarah Winnemucca, a Northern Paiute activist from Nevada; and Mark Twain, who lived and wrote for a newspaper in Virginia City and Carson City, NV in the early 1860s. Each portrait contains a detail pertaining to the individual, for example: buildings on top of DeLonghamps' head; a basket behind the top of Dot So La Lee's head; a brand surrounded by barbed wire on top of Palmer's head; Heizer wears a hat that appears sculpted from metal to symbolize his work as a sculptor; a rendering of the Nevada Historical Society in the broach pinned to Weir's collar; the US Highway sign imposed on Lincoln's head is symbolic of his namesake, US Route 40; a rendering of Johnson knocking Jeffries out during the championship bout; and the top of Twain's head represented as an open book, and a quill pen over his right shoulder. </description>

    <contributor>Children's Cabinet; Reno Police Department; Recycled Records;</contributor>
    <date>2015</date>
    <description>This music-themed mural behind Recycled Records was painted by a group of youth who are part of the Children's Cabinet's &quot;Spray Positive&quot; program. This program was instigated by the Reno Police Department, in collaboration with the Children's Cabinet, as a way to beautify blighted properties in Midtown and Downtown Reno. On the left is a large magenta piano. In the middle, a man wearing a teal fedora, pink shirt, and blue sport coat plays the trumpet. On the right is the abstract profile of a person listening to music on Beats-by-Dre headphones. A curvy music staff flows through the background of the entire composition with green, red, pink, blue and yellow music notes and treble clefs floating along and around it, while a curvy thread of black and white piano keys flows through the foreground of the composition, eventually morphing into the wire that plugs into the headphones.</description>

    <date>2014</date>
    <description>A close up of a wolf's head and face wraps around the back and right side of Vaka and Sarra's mural. The wolf's fur is multicolored: muted shades of purple, yellow, green, blue, and orange. The wolf's eyes are a mint green, its nose is black and purple, and the whiskers on the right side of its face are green, those on the left are purple. Two brown hand prints appear towards the bottom of the left side of the box. Vaka's moniker and the pound sign are painted in white against a black backdrop in the lower-left corner of the back side of the box. The wolf likely relates to the signal box's proximity to the University of Nevada, Reno, whose mascot is the wolf.</description>

    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock combines United States history with the history of Nevada in this mural that was commissioned to celebrate the Historic Lincoln Highway. Abraham Lincoln appears on the left side of the mural, leading to the Nevada flag and then U.S. flag, over which the words &quot;LINCOLN HIGHWAY&quot; are painted in different font styles and are flanked by the Nevada flag and the Interstate 40 highway sign. All subjects combined, this mural conveys the relevance of this president and his namesake highway. </description>

    <description>Bryce Chisholm's mural, painted during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October, 2017, features a a vibrant multicolored background. A young woman on the right and a wolf below her on the left have been painted over the background using a stencil (a technique the artist is known for) and black and white paint. Two thin lines with stars surrounding them encircle the woman. A thin white outline of the number 4 (for 4th Street, where the building upon which the mural resides), surrounded by a blue flourish pattern, are painted in the upper-left side of the mural. An aqua-blue houndstooth pattern has been painted, again with a stencil, in the upper-right corner of the mural.</description>

    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock depicts a cowboy riding a wild mustang into the sunset, representative of the Reno Rodeo, in this mural painted during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October, 2017. A halo of barbed wire floats above the cowboy's hat and a locomotive disguises itself in the body of the mustang. The background is painted bright blue with a beige banner swirling across it that reads &quot;Get Buck Get Broke.&quot; Objects, such as grape bundles, crowns (a common object in Rock's murals), hearts and cherries speckle the mural's background.</description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>This mural painted by artist Joe C. Rock represents the city of Reno, as well as the Statewide Lighting &amp; Accents company (where the mural resides). The center of the mural highlights a large brightly-lit light bulb with a crown (a common object in Rock's paintings) sitting at the top. Behind the light bulb, the city's well-known &quot;Reno&quot; sign hides, acknowledging the brightness of the rising city. The word &quot;BRIGHT&quot; is also woven within the mural behind leaves and orange circles. Underneath the light bulb, the ground from which the bulb rises is visible; the word &quot;IDEAS&quot; is written through a depiction of stones.</description>

    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>As artist Joe C. Rock explains on his website: &quot;This mural was created as an ode to the history of the Midtown area in Reno, NV.  The word 'Midtown' covers the wall in painted exposed brick, transitioning from new, to worn down, to built back up with metal and brackets, just as the area has [b]een throughout the years. Vintage ads and photographs of [influential] people and businesses, [as well as] imagery that helped build up the area are recreated in spray paint and house paint [and] collaged about in a makeshift timeline of the area [that leads] up to a motel sign from the street, re-lettered to say 'look to the future.' A child adorned in an American-flag dress with Lady Liberty's crown, torch, and tablets looks blindly into the future.&quot;</description>

    <description>Bryce Chisholm's mural, painted during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October, 2017, features a a vibrant multicolored background. A young woman on the right and a wolf below her on the left have been painted over the background using a stencil (a technique the artist is known for) and black and white paint. Two thin lines with stars surrounding them encircle the woman. A thin white outline of the number 4 (for 4th Street, where the building upon which the mural resides), surrounded by a blue flourish pattern, are painted in the upper-left side of the mural. An aqua-blue houndstooth pattern has been painted, again with a stencil, in the upper-right corner of the mural. </description>

    <description>This mural is a three-part piece painted by artist Joe C. Rock. The fence here (of three total) depicts a hand-drawn rudimentary map representing Sparks, Reno, Virginia City and Carson City, Nevada. The sage brush that grows horizontally behind the map peaks through holes in the map and the golden-yellow banner from the Nevada state flag wraps around and through the entire seen. A monochromatic portrait of Kit Carson is painted on the-right side of the fence.</description>

    <description>This 65 x (roughly) 16 foot mural pinated on the wall of Peerless Cleaners by artist Erik Burke combines Reno history and Nevada mountain ranges. The mural is speckled with small symbols that depict prominent Reno figures, organizations, and locations in the business's and city's history. Some of these symbols are connected, like constellations, by a line that carries throughout the composition. The mountain-range landscape can also be interpreted as draped fabric, connecting the mural to the the business located in that building. The mural is painted in shades of red, orange, yellow, blue and white.</description>

    <description>In this mural by artist Raphael Blanco, painted during the 24-Hour Mural Marathon in 2017, Blanco depicts a child taking a photograph using a vintage camera. Although the child is painted predominantly with black, Blanco also uses the colors of the background (blue and purple) for the child's skin color and to create highlights in his/her hair. The background is composed of stripes in an array of shades of blue and purple. There are also translucent white splashes &quot;splattered&quot; around the child.</description>

    <description>This monochromatic mural set against a light blue background depicts a camera with a roll of film unraveling from its film compartment. On the unraveled film can be seen the undeveloped images that the camera has captured. A girl holds her dog; a man hangs out the driver-side window of a van and looks at the camera; a man kneels in front of his bicycle; two children ride their bicycles; a man looks to his left with a city street behind him; a man holds two bags (one in each hand) up in the air and smiles at the camera; a woman stands with her hands in her pockets and smiles at the camera; a young girl looks quizzically at the camera; a young man looks back at the camera from the driver-side window of his car; a man stands with his hands in his pockets in front of a light pole; a man with a thick mustache looks directly at the camera, a skull-like object is to the left of him; four children sit together on some steps; a young girl rides a rocking horse. The film roll ends, leading into an orange burst and then beam of light that perhaps represents the light needed to expose the film. The light beam is surrounded by black, blue, and gray clouds.   </description>

    <contributor>Nevada Museum of Art</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>This mural was painted by artist Erik Burke on a cinderblock trash-can enclosure located behind the Nevada Museum of Art (NMA) to coincide with the Tilted Basin Exhibition that ran at the NMA from August through October of 2016. The entire enclose was painted in a vibrant lime green and the male and female figures represented horizontally on the left side, presumably a father and daughter dancing, are painted on top of the lime-green background using darker shades of green and black paint. Dark-green paint was used to create a cat-like design on the portion of the girl's dress that covers her arms, shoulders and upper back, and to create a simple floral pattern on the remaining (lower) portion of the dress. A bit a of white paint was used to create the metal appearance of the man's wedding band and to paint Burke's moniker (OU37) in the upper-left corner. According to the NMA website, the Tilted Basin Exhibition &quot;bridges the divide between Northern and Southern Nevada communities and provides a wide-ranging overview and understanding of the most accomplished work being created by more than thirty artists living and working in Nevada today.&quot;</description>

    <description>This signal-box mural by Devin Hosselkus is Reno themed. Reno's slogan,&quot;Reno: the Biggest Little City in the World,&quot; wraps around the box, as do renderings of the various versions of the Reno arches (the original version with slogan: installed in 1929; the second version: installed in 1963; and the current version: installed in 1987). Hosselkus used a simple color palette consisting of navy blue, teal, red, tan and brown, grey, white, and black.</description>

A girl holds her dog; a man hangs out the driver-side window of a van and looks at the camera; a man kneels in front of his bicycle; two children ride their bicycles; a man looks to his left with a city street behind him; a man holds two bags (one in each hand) up in the air and smiles at the camera; a woman stands with her hands in her pockets and smiles at the camera; a young girl looks quizzically at the camera; a young man looks back at the camera from the driver-side window of his car; a man stands with his hands in his pockets in front of a light pole; a man with a thick mustache looks directly at the camera, a skull-like object is to the left of him; four children sit together on some steps; a young girl rides a rocking horse. The film roll ends, leading into an orange burst and then beam of light that perhaps represents the light needed to expose the film. The light beam is surrounded by black, blue, and gray clouds.     </description>

    <description>This signal-box mural by Devin Hosselkus is Reno themed. Reno's slogan,&quot;Reno: the Biggest Little City in the World,&quot; wraps around the box, as do renderings of the various versions of the Reno arches (the original version with slogan: installed in 1929; the second version: installed in 1963; and the current version: installed in 1987). Hosselkus used a simple color palette consisting of navy blue, teal, red, tan and brown, grey, white, and black.</description>

    <description>Painted on a warehouse on Dickerson Road, a location known to draw in local street artists, this mural conveys the vibrancy of the art culture there. Composed by several different artists, this mural combines portraiture, animations and vibrant colors that become a collage of a mural. The mural depicts two portraits of women, a pink animated cat-like figure, a four-eyed monster wearing a party hat, a large peanut, a floating brick wall with a graffiti artist painting on it, and a Day of the Dead skull. The mural overall is painted in shades of blue, pink, green, yellow, red, green, grey, and beige.</description>

    <description>This mural is a three-part piece painted by artist Joe C. Rock. The two fences here (of three total) converge into a nautical star with monochromatic portraits of Jesse Lee Reno to the left and John Sparks to the right. Sage brush grows horizontally from each man's face. On the left (Reno) side of the fence, Nevada's nickname/slogan &quot;Battle Born&quot; is painted in black along the length of the fence, against a rich blue background. A mountain bluebird perches on the sagebrush in front of the &quot;B&quot; in &quot;Born.&quot; The golden-yellow banner from the Nevada state flag wraps around flows through the entire scene. On the far-right end of the right (Sparks) side of the fence is a depiction of the Nevada bicentennial coin. Barbed wire winds around the sagebrush on this side of the fence, and the golden-yellow banner from the Nevada state flag wraps around flows through the entire scene.</description>

    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits. This portrait is of Ben Palmer, one of the original settlers of and most successful ranchers in the Carson Valley, as symbolized by the brand surrounded by barbed wire on top of his head.</description>

    <contributor>NA</contributor>
    <date>2012</date>
    <description>This collaborative mural by artists Erik Burke and Labrona (from Montreal) resided (has since been painted over) at the Holland Project, &quot;an all-ages arts and music initiative by young people, for young people&quot; (https://www.hollandreno.org/about/). The portion painted by Burke depicts &quot;George W. G. Ferris Jr. who grew up in the Nevada Capital and nearby city of Carson in 1870's...[and] entered notoriety after conceptualizing and engineering the Ferris Wheel for the 1893 World Fair in Chicago&quot; (http://eriktburke.com/Holland-Project). Ferris Jr.'s cranium is exposed and transitions into the wheel he was called &quot;the man with wheels in is head&quot; for inventing (http://eriktburke.com/Holland-Project). The figures that flank Ferris Jr. (painted by Labrona) embody a cubist style of painting. Each of these figures wears an unorthodox hat: a house, and a goose. The background is composed of geometric shapes.</description>

    <contributor>The Melting Pot World Emporium &amp; Smoke Shop</contributor>
    <date>2015</date>
    <description>This mural depicts a large brown octopus mixed with peacock feathers and a human-like figure. The octopus is the focus of the mural. The body of the octopus is painted in a palette of browns, while its suckers are painted in a palette of blue. The peacock feathers almost resemble the suckers as they intertwine into the octopus's tentacles. The tentacles wrap around and burst through a portrait of a blue human-like figure wearing headphones that emerges from the mud-cracked ground, perhaps representing Burning Man since the business upon which the mural is painted, The Melting Pot World Emporium, is one of the leading retailers of Playa gear in the area. The figure stares out into the distance. A tentacle bursts through the middle portrait, which depicts the Burning Man logo centered in the Burning-Man-Playa landscape with planets hanging in the night sky above. The last portrait is a circus-style wall sign for the The Melting Pot. A curtain opens up to a stage with silhouettes of people dancing in front of an earth with sun rays around it. The background of the entire mural is painted a bright red, contrasting the aquatic and desert ambiance of the subject matter. </description>

    <description>The front side of Ashley Follmer's signal-box mural depicts a woman wearing a light blue dress with her hands held behind her back. The section of the woman where her neck and head should be erupts into a huge cloud that transitions from dark orange on the left, to yellow, to white on the right. The woman is painted against a background that transitions from bright yellow at the bottom, to lime green, to a deeper green at the top. The subject of this mural might relate to its location on the University of Nevada, Reno campus: perhaps the figure's head is exploding from the knowledge it has acquired (as in, &quot;mind blown!&quot;).</description>

    <title>Unknown [Aquatic Elements: Mural for Stingray Tattoo]</title>
    <creator>Vaka</creator>
    <contributor>Stingray Tattoo</contributor>
    <date>2014-2016</date>
    <description>This under-the-sea-themed mural was painted by artist Vaka on the exterior of Stingray Tattoo, where he works as a tattoo artist. Several dark blue stingrays swim throughout the mural that wraps around two adjacent walls on the northeast side of the tattoo parlor, covers the ceiling that overhangs the walls and spills into the pavement below. Two orange, white and black clown fish swim through some purple sea anemones and and light blue sponges that emerge from the bottom corner of the mural where the two walls meet. On the far right side (northern wall) of the mural, a massive ray swims towards some red coral that flanks a window. On the left side (eastern wall) of the mural, a word (possibly &quot;Ink&quot;) is painted red and white in flourish font, while the same paint colors are used on the cinderblocks of the wall to create the illusion that the wall is breaking and falling into the sea; several of these broken blocks float throughout the mural. </description>

    <description>This mural is a three-part piece painted by artist Joe C. Rock. The two fences here  (of three total) converge into a nautical star with monochromatic portraits of Jesse Lee Reno to the left and John Sparks to the right. Sage brush grows horizontally from each man's face. On the far-right end of the right (Sparks) side of the fence is a depiction of the Nevada bicentennial coin. Barbed wire winds around the sagebrush on this side of the fence, and the golden-yellow banner from the Nevada state flag wraps around flows through the entire scene.</description>

    <date>2008</date>
    <description>Devin Hosselkus' signal-box mural depicts various individuals in a city-like setting (perhaps downtown Reno, given the location of the box just north of the Virginia Street Bridge over the Truckee River). In the foreground of the front side of the box is the profile of a person with gray hair and purple skin, wearing a green shirt and brown paints, apparently walking towards the left. In the background and what appears to be across the street, from left to right: a person wearing a white shirt and blue pants sits on a wooden bench; a man wearing a white tank tops looks across the street; a man with blue skin, wearing a white shirt and brown pants walks towards the left; a person wearing a maroon shirt walks in the opposite direction; a person wearing a white bandana, black shirt and gray pants has their back turned away from the viewer. A body of water (presumably the Truckee River) flows under a bridge and street lights behind and to the right of the person in the foreground. On the left side of the box, a street and crosswalk, with its wide white lines, is depicted. Two brown birds appear in the lower-right corner.</description>

    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C.

Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits, spanning the entire 250 x 20 foot mural. The portraits, from left to right, are as follows: Frederic DeLongchamps, one of Nevada's most prolific architects; Dot So La Lee, a basket weaver and member of the northwestern Nevada Washoe; Wovoka, a Paiute religious leader; Ben Palmer, one of the original settlers of and most successful ranchers in the Carson Valley; Michael Heizer, a contemporary artist whose life-long project, City, is &quot;the largest piece of contemporary art ever attempted&quot; (http://doublenegative.tarasen.net/city/)&quot;;</description>

    <title>Unknown [Headquarters Bar Crawl Mural]</title>
    <creator>UTI Crew; Spek;</creator>
    <contributor>Art Spot Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>The theme of this vibrant mural, painted by members of UTI Crew during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, directly relates to the location in which it is painted: the wall of Headquarters Bar, a bar owned and operated by &quot;Crawl Reno, the organizers of the Reno Zombie Crawl and a ton of other massive parties in downtown Reno&quot; (http://headquartersreno.com/#home_about). On the right side of the mural stands a man with characteristics representative of the various crawls that take place in Reno throughout the year. The red Santa hat he wears with gold polka dots and a gold fur ball gestures towards the Santa Crawl; his green beard gestures towards the Leprechaun Crawl; and the Superman shirt he wears gestures towards the Super Hero Crawl. On the left side of the mural is a zombie with a mask resting on the top of its head, representing both the Zombie and Mardi Gras Crawls. These two figures flank four separate graffiti-style words (one of which appears to be the moniker of one of the UTI Crew members, Spek). In the background of the mural, a city skyline goes up in flames, perhaps caused by the man on the left who holds a lit match in his right hand, a mug of bear in his left. To the left of the mural is a small chain link fence with wood slats upon which &quot;The Crawl&quot; is painted in aqua, turquoise and sky blue horror font against a yellow and orange background with red splatters. </description>

    <description>This painted-wall sign welcomes those driving past it to Dickerson Road, an area west of downtown Reno, running parallel to the Truckee River, that is referred to as &quot;'Reno’s Industrial Arts District,' combining art, commercial and residential properties, and a nature preserve.&quot; Using bright and vibrant colors, Eric (Erik) Burke and Buz Rhodes painted large block letters, with orange and red shadows behind them, to spell out &quot;Dickerson,&quot; with imagery and scenes appearing in each letter that signify and represent the nature of the district. The &quot;D&quot; features an angle grinder cutting metal; a paint brush stands in for the &quot;I&quot;; the &quot;C&quot; features the profile of half of a sandwich; the &quot;K&quot; displays a smith forging a piece of metal; the &quot;E&quot; shows someone wearing tan pants and brown boots laying under the hood of a vehicle; the &quot;R&quot; features a woman's body in profile from her lower torso to the top of her knees, wearing a black and white striped undergarment, with red rose vines over the entire image; the &quot;S&quot; contains water with green and purple lily pads floating on top; the &quot;O&quot; is made up of a figure wearing tan garments throwing on a yellow pottery wheel; and the &quot;N&quot; includes a variety of multicolored metal bottle caps. The words &quot;Welcome to&quot; and &quot;Live, Work, Eat, Play&quot; appear in red and blue on a white banner painted on the left side of the mural. The artists' names,&quot;Eric Burke and Buz Rhodes,&quot; appear in red and blue on a white banner painted in the upper far-right corner of the mural.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Aquatic Elements: Mural for Stingray Tattoo]</title>
    <creator>Vaka</creator>
    <contributor>Stingray Tattoo</contributor>
    <date>2014-2016</date>
    <description>This under-the-sea-themed mural was painted by artist Vaka on the exterior of Stingray Tattoo, where he works as a tattoo artist. Several dark blue stingrays swim throughout the mural that wraps around two adjacent walls on the northeast side of the tattoo parlor, covers the ceiling that overhangs the walls and spills into the pavement below. Two orange, white and black clown fish swim through some purple sea anemones and and light blue sponges that emerge from the bottom corner of the mural where the two walls meet. On the far right side (northern wall) of the mural, a massive ray swims towards some red coral that flanks a window. On the left side (eastern wall) of the mural, a word (possibly &quot;Ink&quot;) is painted red and white in flourish font, while the same paint colors are used on the cinderblocks of the wall to create the illusion that the wall is breaking and falling into the sea; several of these broken blocks float throughout the mural. </description>

    <title>Unknown [Octopus, Peacock Feathers, Futuristic Head]</title>
    <creator>Pittman, Adam (Naem); Pittman, Adam;</creator>
    <contributor>The Melting Pot World Emporium &amp; Smoke Shop</contributor>
    <date>2015</date>
    <description>This mural depicts a large brown octopus mixed with peacock feathers and a human-like figure. The octopus is the focus of the mural. The body of the octopus is painted in a palette of browns, while its suckers are painted in a palette of blue. The peacock feathers almost resemble the suckers as they intertwine into the octopus's tentacles. The tentacles wrap around and burst through a portrait of a blue human-like figure wearing headphones that emerges from the mud-cracked ground, perhaps representing Burning Man since the business upon which the mural is painted, The Melting Pot World Emporium, is one of the leading retailers of Playa gear in the area. The figure stares out into the distance. A tentacle bursts through the middle portrait, which depicts the Burning Man logo centered in the Burning-Man-Playa landscape with planets hanging in the night sky above. The last portrait is a circus-style wall sign for the The Melting Pot. A curtain opens up to a stage with silhouettes of people dancing in front of an earth with sun rays around it. The background of the entire mural is painted a bright red, contrasting the aquatic and desert ambiance of the subject matter. </description>

    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2012</date>
    <description>The right side of this signal box painted by Vaka features the left side of a rodeo clown. The side of the white cowboy hat with red trim that the clown wears can be seen, as can the clown's ear, and a small portion of his neck, adorned with a red neckerchief, worn above a blue shirt with white stripes along the shoulders. Behind the clown is a multicolored background speckled with yellow, blue, red and green handprints. The theme of this signal box relates to its proximity to the Reno Livestock Events Center, the venue for the Reno Rodeo.</description>

    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>In this painting, artist Jennifer Charboneau reinterprets Paul Cezanne's infamous modernist style painting, The Basket of Apples. Like Cezanne, Charboneau abstracts still-life painting by alluding to objects without defining their form. Charboneau uses shades of red, orange, yellow, blue, green, and white for this work. Lastly, Charboneau adds black font and her signature on the left side of work.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Headquarters Bar Crawl Mural]</title>
    <creator>UTI Crew; Spek;</creator>
    <contributor>Art Spot Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>The theme of this vibrant mural, painted by members of UTI Crew during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, directly relates to the location in which it is painted: the wall of Headquarters Bar, a bar owned and operated by &quot;Crawl Reno, the organizers of the Reno Zombie Crawl and a ton of other massive parties in downtown Reno&quot; (http://headquartersreno.com/#home_about). On the right side of the mural stands a man with characteristics representative of the various crawls that take place in Reno throughout the year. The red Santa hat he wears with gold polka dots and a gold fur ball gestures towards the Santa Crawl; his green beard gestures towards the Leprechaun Crawl; and the Superman shirt he wears gestures towards the Super Hero Crawl. On the left side of the mural is a zombie with a mask resting on the top of its head, representing both the Zombie and Mardi Gras Crawls. These two figures flank four separate graffiti-style words (one of which appears to be the moniker of one of the UTI Crew members, Spek). In the background of the mural, a city skyline goes up in flames, perhaps caused by the man on the left who holds a lit match in his right hand, a mug of bear in his left. To the left of the mural is a small chain link fence with wood slats upon which &quot;The Crawl&quot; is painted in aqua, turquoise and sky blue horror font against a yellow and orange background with red splatters. </description>

    <contributor>Art Spot Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Five panels of this wall were painted by five different artists during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017. The three here were painted by artists Rafael Blanco, Hernan Borrero and Bryce Chishol. Blanco paints an elderly woman wearing an dark-green head covering with an American flag superimposed on her face. The woman is painted against a black background with translucent white splatters around her; Borrero paints an animated bindle-carrying dog smoking in front of an idle motel located in the southwestern desert, suggested by the magenta cacti. The mural is painted in shades of green, pink, purple, yellow, black, and brown; Chisholm's mural features a a vibrant multicolored background. A young woman on the right and a wolf below her on the left have been painted over the background using a stencil (a technique the artist is known for) and black and white paint. Two thin lines with stars surrounding them encircled the woman. A thin white outline of the number 4 (for 4th Street, where the building upon which the mural resides), surrounded by a blue flourish pattern, are painted in the upper-left side of the mural. An aqua-blue houndstooth pattern has been painted (again, with a stencil) in the upper-right corner of the mural.</description>

    <description>This monochromatic mural set against a light blue background depicts a camera with a roll of film unraveling from its film compartment. On the unraveled film can be seen the undeveloped images that the camera has captured. A girl holds her dog; a man hangs out the driver-side window of a van and looks at the camera; a man kneels in front of his bicycle; two children ride their bicycles; a man looks to his left with a city street behind him; a man holds two bags (one in each hand) up in the air and smiles at the camera; a woman stands with her hands in her pockets and smiles at the camera; a young girl looks quizzically at the camera; a young man looks back at the camera from the driver-side window of his car; a man stands with his hands in his pockets in front of a light pole; a man with a thick mustache looks directly at the camera, a skull-like object is to the left of him; four children sit together on some steps; a young girl rides a rocking horse. The film roll ends, leading into an orange burst and then beam of light that perhaps represents the light needed to expose the film. The light beam is surrounded by black, blue, and gray clouds.     </description>

    <description>Farm animals (a cow, pig, and chicken) stand around a brown barn and look over a split rail fence that encloses a garden plot. Floating in the middle of and above the plot is a large red heart, the inside exposed from the middle down. Plants with red stems grow out of the top of the heart, their roots grow out of the bottom. The plants and their roots by be representative of arteries.</description>

    <creator>Kurt, Lisa; Coffy, Joshua; Darragh, Jamie;</creator>
    <contributor>Art Spot Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Five panels of this wall were painted by five different artists during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017. The three here are by artists Lisa Kurt, Joshua Coffy, and Jamie Darragh. Kurt paints a black fox standing in a meadow within a forest landscape. Surrounding the fox are trees, bushes, tumbleweed and a ghost. Kurt uses yellow, orange, green, black, and white to paint this mural; Coffy's mural features a black bear with ryukin fish swimming around it. The bottom third of the mural's background is an aegean-blue color, perhaps representative of water, while the rest of the background is tan with chiffon circles (or bubbles). A grid of eleven colors has been painted in the top middle of the mural; An aqua-blue alien head with bulbous black eyes painted against a black background is the subject of Darragh's mural. The alien's head is adorned with a metallic-gold head piece with nine graduated white circles centered above. Three different metallic-gold medallions float behind the alien head and seven different moon phases are depicted above the alien's head. Metallic gold appears at the very top of the mural. Darragh's Instagram handle, @j.darragh.art, is painted in metallic gold on the bottom-right corner of the mural.</description>

    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). This portrait is of Ben Palmer, one of the original settlers of and most successful ranchers in the Carson Valley, as symbolized by the brand surrounded by barbed wire on top of his head. </description>

    <description>This signal-box mural by Devin Hosselkus is Reno themed. Reno's slogan,&quot;Reno: the Biggest Little City in the World,&quot; wraps around the box, as do renderings of the various versions of the Reno arches (the original version with slogan: installed in 1929; the second version: installed in 1963; and the current version: installed in 1987). Hosselkus used a simple color palette consisting of navy blue, teal, red, tan and brown, grey, white, and black.</description>

The lobster has been painted using several shades of orange and black, but the details of and sheen on the lobster was created using a variety of unexpected colors: sky, cerulean and periwinkle blue; yellow; peach; fern and crocodile green; lavender and iris purple; and red. Burke's moniker (OU38) and website (eriktburke.com) are painted in light blue on the bottom-left corner. The mural is 24 x 44 ft.</description>

    <description>Artist Bryce Chisholm painted this &quot;Super Boy&quot; on his 16 x 20 foot panel of the Nevada Fine Arts wall using a stencil (a technique Chisholm is known for). Outfitted in a red and black cape and mask, with a star emblazoned on his chest, the boy strikes a heroic pose against a colorful background of various geometric shapes and patterns. Flying pigeons speckle the mural, while one is perched in the upper-left corner.</description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>The front of Michael Lucido's electric-box mural features a skateboarding raccoon wearing 3D glasses. The raccoon's mouth is so wide open you can see its uvula, its tongue hangs out and is wind-blown towards that back of his head, as is saliva. The raccoon rides an aqua-blue skateboard with pink wheels against a turquoise background, grasping the board with its right hand as it does a trick, its left arm is raised high in the air. The  skateboarding theme of this box possibly relates to its location at City Park Plaza, used in the past as an unofficial skate park.</description>

    <description>At 28 x 140 ft., Erik Burke's mural, Camouflage, is the largest painted during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017. The mural abstracts images such as a pioneer woman on riding a horse, cacti, and sheep that represent Nevada's historical past as well as its promising future. The top of the mural reads &quot;Look to the Pasture to see the Future,&quot; conveying the influence that the natural landscape, farming and ranching has had in this state.</description>

    <creator>Ortega, Anthony;</creator>
    <contributor>Art Spot Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>In this mural, artist Anthony Ortega paints a bright owl with super powers roaming the night. The owl is painted in shades of pink, orange, purple, red, beige, and green; it is draped with a  blue cloak with geometric shapes. The owl has green light rays beaming from its eyes into the bottom right corner of the mural. The sky is painted in dark blues and black with swirling white clouds. The style of the mural pays homage to Japanese anime, referenced through the animated owl, it's wardrobe, it's &quot;super power,&quot; and the anime-style clouds.</description>

    <creator>Chisholm, Bryce (ABC Art Attack)</creator>
    <contributor></contributor>
    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>The focal point of Bryce Chisholm's electric-box mural is the profile of a girl holding an umbrella with her face resting in the palm of her right hand as she looks down at the ground. She is painted in black and white, using a stencil (a technique Chisholm is known for). Her striped tights are light blue and black. She stands against a purple background. Puffy white rain clouds outlined in red and pouring red rain drops surround the girl. The background is speckled with yellow, blue, and pink dashes, lines, and brushstrokes. On the left side of the box, from the middle up, is a white stenciled geometric pattern. The original green color of the box shows through certain areas. Chisholm's moniker (ABC) is painted in white on the lower-left corner of the box.</description>

    <description>The focal point of artist Seth McCorkle's signal-box mural is the mountain chickadee, common in the mountains of Nevada. On the back side of the box, a single dickadee is perched on a branch of a plant or tree, with a little green foliage on it. A cerulean-blue body of water appears in the background, with a light blue sky with fluffy-white clouds above. McCorkle's moniker and the date are painted in light blue on the bottom-left corner of the box.</description>

    <description>This monochromatic mural set against a light blue background depicts a camera with a roll of film unraveling from its film compartment. On the unraveled film can be seen the undeveloped images that the camera has captured. A girl holds her dog; a man hangs out the driver-side window of a van and looks at the camera; a man kneels in front of his bicycle; two children ride their bicycles; a man looks to his left with a city street behind him; a man holds two bags (one in each hand) up in the air and smiles at the camera; a woman stands with her hands in her pockets and smiles at the camera; a young girl looks quizzically at the camera; a young man looks back at the camera from the driver-side window of his car; a man stands with his hands in his pockets in front of a light pole; a man with a thick mustache looks directly at the camera, a skull-like object is to the left of him; four children sit together on some steps; a young girl rides a rocking horse. The film roll ends, leading into an orange burst and then beam of light that perhaps represents the light needed to expose the film. The light beam is surrounded by black, blue, and gray clouds.     </description>

    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits. This portrait is of Sarah Winnemucca, a Northern Paiute activist from Nevada.</description>

    <description>The theme of the mural on this detached garage, painted by Joe C. Rock, relates to its location behind Marmot Properties, one of the foremost real estate development companies in Reno that is particularly active in the Midtown area. The entire structure is painted bright green. On the east-facing wall is a monochromatic scene of three marmots behind some plants with the words &quot;Things Change&quot; painted in white over the scene. A crown hangs over the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;things.&quot; The words are transparent and reveal what is behind them, except the &quot;thi&quot; in &quot;things,&quot; which reveal a house and fence. The marmots on this wall represent Marmot Properties, while &quot;Things Change&quot; and the house and fence scene contained in the &quot;thi&quot; gestures towards Marmot's role in transforming the area's landscape, demography and culture through their development activities.</description>

    <description>Anthony Ortega won the 2017 24-Hour Mural Marathon competition with a psychedelic mural composition that combines ancient Mesoamerican art with futuristic elements. This mural is painted with vibrant shades of blue, red, green, orange, yellow, pink, and purple, portraying a vivid ancient Mesoamerican god-like figure that emerges from the stellar depths of the galaxy behind it and begins its descent into the green forest that surrounds the outer edges of the mural.</description>

    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>As artist Joe C. Rock explains on his website: &quot;This mural was created as an ode to the history of the Midtown area in Reno, NV.  The word 'Midtown' covers the wall in painted exposed brick, transitioning from new, to worn down, to built back up with metal and brackets, just as the area has [b]een throughout the years. Vintage ads and photographs of [influential] people and businesses, [as well as] imagery that helped build up the area are recreated in spray paint and house paint [and] collaged about in a makeshift timeline of the area [that leads] up to a motel sign from the street, re-lettered to say 'look to the future.' A child adorned in an American-flag dress with Lady Liberty's crown, torch, and tablets looks blindly into the future.&quot; </description>

    <date>2015</date>
    <description>A Buddha-like figure with three eyes, the middle of which has green and magenta rays beaming from it towards the sky, is the focal point of this mural by Garrison Buxton. A rainbow of colors emerge from the figure's mouth, eventually casting an orange and lavender background upon which the phrase &quot;Thoughts Are Things&quot; is painted in white. The yin-and-yang symbol hangs on a green necklace around the figure's neck, below which the phrase &quot;Know Thy Self&quot; appears on a banner across the figure's torso. To the right of the figure, the phrase &quot;Be Kind&quot; is painted in white against a periwinkle background. Buxton's moniker is painted in metallic gold on the bottom-right corner of the mural.</description>

    <creator>Rock, Joe C.</creator>
    <contributor>NA</contributor>
    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>A fluid mural is painted by artist Joe C. Rock on this three-sided fence. The mural begins with the head of a woman in front of clouds whose hair then flows throughout the mural, as do the clouds. An array of subject matter appear among the hair and clouds over a light-blue background. While some figures portray recognizable figures, such as dice, eye balls, power lines, butterflies, rain drops, a bee, a rose, a mountain range, and botehs (the teardrop-shaped motif with a curved upper end that comprises the paisley pattern), other subjects and figures are more abstract, or focus on written text.</description>

    <description>The lower portion of the profile of a wolf howling against a blue, green and white background appears on the front side of Vaka and Sarra's signal-box mural. The wolf's fur is multicolored: muted shades of purple, yellow, green, blue, and orange. The wolf likely relates to the signal box's proximity to the University of Nevada, Reno, whose mascot is the wolf.</description>

    <description>Devin Hosselkus' signal-box mural depicts various individuals in a city-like setting (perhaps downtown Reno, given the location of the box just north of the Virginia Street Bridge over the Truckee River). On the back side of the box is a man with white hair and a gray beard, wearing a dark blue shirt and tan pants. To his left is a large pot with white, red, and purple flowers. Another pot with white flowers hangs from a metal post.</description>

    <description>Artist Erik Burke painted this beer-and-wine themed  45 x 18 foot mural to coincide with the business upon which it resides, Craft Wine and Beer. Dark brown beer bottles and green and pink wine bottles, all with various labels, are painted against a cerulean-blue background. The bottles are painted in a repeating pattern wherein either: one bottle faces right-way up while another is turned upside down with a stream beer or wine flowing between the mouths of the bottles; or one bottle faces right-way up while the other is turned upside and the bases of bottles rest on each other. The largest bottle and focal point of the mural is a beer bottle with a monochromatic label depicting a hops farmer and that reads &quot;Craft Wine Beer.&quot;</description>

    <description>The front side of Cathy Ashworth's signal-box mural portrays Reno pride. In the center of the work lies a red heart with a banner across it that reads &quot;Reno.&quot; Like the back of the box, fire also arises from the heart and the Burning Man logo appears in the main flame. The background is then divided into sections that depict scenery relating to northern Nevada. On the left side of the box, a red heart arise from the ground, as if it were a plant. The fire atop the heart gravitates towards the vibrant yellow sun.</description>

    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2012</date>
    <description>In this collaborative piece painted by Erik Burke, Kelly Peyton, and Kaitlyn Bryson, a male figure wearing dark blue jeans and a yellow tank top lays on his back in front of a blue background with hands interlaced and resting on his stomach. It appears as though the man is floating. In the bottom-left corner of the mural, circular, triangular, other geometric shapes, and dashes are painted on the man's pants in a shade of blue lighter than the pants and more like that of the background. Similar shapes are painted in marigold yellow on the man's shirt, as are figures fashioned out of the letters &quot;L&quot; and &quot;D&quot; and the number &quot;4&quot; (L4, D4); these figures represent the phrase &quot;Live for What You Would Die For.&quot; These figures, and the phrase they represent, likely relate to the theme and purpose of the mural, referred to by one if its painters, Burke, as a tribute to Beau Shaver of Reno, NV who is also likely the man depicted in the mural. The man also has various shapes (hearts, roses, the outline of a crown) and words painted in yellow on his arm, neck, face and teeth. The background of the right side of the mural is painted in graduated shades of blue (light to dark, from the bottom to the top). An upside down brown hat appears in the lower-right corner of the mural, it has currant-red-outlined-in-yellow flowers sitting on the brim and one flower peaking out from inside. Burke's moniker (OU33), the other two artists' initials (KP and Kb), and the date (2012) are painted in white in the upper-right corner of the mural, with &quot;L4D4 SODC SHAVER&quot; painted below. The mural is 80 x 16 ft.</description>

    <date>2012</date>
    <description>According to the artist of this monochromatic mural,  Joe C. Rock, &quot;I initially painted this because I walked by this door daily and it had an 'I smoke meth' tag...on [it] for a month. I took the initiative and painted a portrait in the likeness of J.F.K. as a child over it [and] the man who owns the building liked it and it's been there ever since&quot;&quot;(https://www.instagram.com/p/BJPRYGMhqZK/?taken-by=joecrock13). The young JFK wears a striped shirt and the outline of a small gold crown (not present at the time this photograph was taken) sits atop his head.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Octopus, Peacock Feathers, Futuristic Head]</title>
    <creator>Pittman, Adam (Naem); Pittman, Adam;</creator>
    <contributor>The Melting Pot World Emporium &amp; Smoke Shop</contributor>
    <date>2015</date>
    <description>This mural depicts a large brown octopus mixed with peacock feathers and a human-like figure. The octopus is the focus of the mural. The body of the octopus is painted in a palette of browns, while its suckers are painted in a palette of blue. The peacock feathers almost resemble the suckers as they intertwine into the octopus's tentacles. The tentacles wrap around and burst through a portrait of a blue human-like figure wearing headphones that emerges from the mud-cracked ground, perhaps representing Burning Man since the business upon which the mural is painted, The Melting Pot World Emporium, is one of the leading retailers of Playa gear in the area. The figure stares out into the distance. A tentacle bursts through the middle portrait, which depicts the Burning Man logo centered in the Burning-Man-Playa landscape with planets hanging in the night sky above. The last portrait is a circus-style wall sign for the The Melting Pot. A curtain opens up to a stage with silhouettes of people dancing in front of an earth with sun rays around it. The background of the entire mural is painted a bright red, contrasting the aquatic and desert ambiance of the subject matter. </description>

    <description>&quot;DAYDREAM!&quot; appears in all caps in this mural that artist Joe C. Rock painted on a chain link fence with wood slats. Enclosed within the block letters is green grass against a blue skyline. The letters are outlined in white and cast red shadows outlined in peach. Growing out of the grass in the first &quot;D&quot; is a blue flower. A butterfly with blue wings perches on the outside edge of the second &quot;D&quot; and a lady bug crawls across the grass. A red rose rests on the left side of the &quot;R.&quot; A worm slithers through the grass, straddling the right side of the &quot;R&quot; and left side of the &quot;E,&quot; disappearing and re-emerging out of the right side of the &quot;E.&quot; A blue flower with a lady bug on it grows out of the grass in the dot of the exclamation point. </description>

    <contributor>Sutro Motel</contributor>
    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>This mural painted on the Sutro Motel depicts the Sutro Tunnel: &quot;a drainage tunnel (adit) connected to the Comstock Lode in Northern Nevada. It begins at Virginia City, Nevada and empties approximately 6 miles southeast near the town of Dayton, Nevada&quot; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutro_Tunnel). A mule-drawn mine cart with people riding in it emerges from the tunnel on a mine railway that leads to a shirtless thickly-mustached man (perhaps Adolf Sutro, the engineer of the tunnel) holding a lantern. To the left of the tunnel is the word &quot;Comstock,&quot; behind which a banner begins and flows across the mural and into a flourish design in the lower-right corner of the mural. The words &quot;Battle Born&quot; appear on the banner over the right shoulder of the man and the words &quot;Silver State&quot; appear on the portion of the banner that flows around and flanks the mine railway. Over the man's left shoulder, &quot;$1,000&quot; is painted in a gray bubble in front of the banner.</description>

    <contributor>Stingray Tattoo</contributor>
    <date>2014-2016</date>
    <description>This under-the-sea-themed mural was painted by artist Vaka on the exterior of Stingray Tattoo, where he works as a tattoo artist. Several dark blue stingrays swim throughout the mural that wraps around two adjacent walls on the northeast side of the tattoo parlor, covers the ceiling that overhangs the walls and spills into the pavement below. Two orange, white and black clown fish swim through some purple sea anemones and and light blue sponges that emerge from the bottom corner of the mural where the two walls meet. On the far right side (northern wall) of the mural, a massive ray swims towards some red coral that flanks a window. On the left side (eastern wall) of the mural, a word (possibly &quot;Ink&quot;) is painted red and white in flourish font, while the same paint colors are used on the cinderblocks of the wall to create the illusion that the wall is breaking and falling into the sea; several of these broken blocks float throughout the mural. </description>

    <description>This wheat-paste mural, installed by Dr. Chip Thomas during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017 portrays the face of a woman with a black mask painted over her eyes, the words &quot;I Am The Change&quot; across appear her forehead, and &quot;Industrialization, Pollution, Drought, Water, Air, Earth, Fake Snow, CO2&quot; appear across here cheeks, nose, upper lip and chin. As Thomas explains, the mural contains a message about the environment, climate change, and social responsibility, and the word &quot;snow,&quot; specifically, &quot;...references the snow bowl ski resort in flagstaff using reclaimed waste water to make fake snow on a mountain sacred to 13 different area tribes&quot; (https://www.instagram.com/p/BefEAalAHkS/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=jetsonorama).</description>

    <contributor>The Potentialist</contributor>
    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>These three murals were painted by different artists on the back wall of the Potentialist Workshop, &quot;a multidisciplinary collaborative arts collective in Reno, Nevada...The Potentialist Gallery is a space for innovative and experimental art by artists creating and exploring multiple artistic platforms&quot;(http://www.potentialistworkshop.com/). On the left, artist Asa Kennedy paints a foreground of individual cubes, perhaps representing cracked pavement, comprised of purple, yellow, and green brush strokes. The cubes begin to float towards the sky in the middle of the composition. The foreground parts in the middle, revealing a dark-purple flower with a bright-orange center. Behind the flower is a light-purple plain with dark-purple mountains on the horizon. Above, white and purple clouds swirl around a blue sky and merge with the rising cubes. The middle mural depicts a white dairy cow with black spots raising her head to the bright-blue sky with fluffy white clouds, a bell on a red collar hangs around her neck. A pig with white spots, a piggy-bank slot on its back, and a yellow crown on its head stands in front of the cow's left-front quarter, facing the opposite direction. A rendering of a brick building appears oddly in the middle of the composition (where a window with a brick ledge naturally existed), with a cardinal perched on the right corner. The mural on the right depicts a monochromatic woman with hair comprised of roses coifed into an afro. She brings her right arm under her left, wrapping it around her torso. Painted on the step leading to the roller door to the left of the woman is a red tunnel with concentric black circles and blue, yellow and red circles floating in it, perhaps representing a galaxy with planets in orbit. A blue snake-like figure slithers through the tunnel. What appears to be the teeth of the lower jaw of an animal are portrayed in the lower foreground of the composition, perhaps suggesting that the the tunnel is mouth.</description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>This mural painted by artist Joe C. Rock represents the city of Reno, as well as the Statewide Lighting &amp; Accents company (where the mural resides). The center of the mural highlights a large brightly-lit light bulb with a crown (a common object in Rock's paintings) sitting at the top. Behind the light bulb, the city's well-known &quot;Reno&quot; sign hides, acknowledging the brightness of the rising city. The word &quot;BRIGHT&quot; is also woven within the mural behind leaves and orange circles. Underneath the light bulb, the ground from which the bulb rises is visible; the word &quot;IDEAS&quot; is written through a depiction of stones.</description>

    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock depicts a cowboy riding a wild mustang into the sunset, representative of the Reno Rodeo, in this mural painted during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October, 2017. A halo of barbed wire floats above the cowboy's hat and a locomotive disguises itself in the body of the mustang. The background is painted bright blue with a beige banner swirling across it that reads &quot;Get Buck Get Broke.&quot; Objects, such as grape bundles, crowns (a common object in Rock's murals), hearts and cherries speckle the mural's background.</description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Artist Hernan Borrero paints an animated bindle-carrying dog smoking in front of an idle motel located in the southwestern desert, suggested by the magenta cacti. The mural is painted in shades of green, pink, purple, yellow, black, and brown. Bryce Chisholm's mural features a a vibrant multicolored background. A young woman on the right and a wolf below her on the left have been painted over the background using a stencil (a technique the artist is known for) and black and white paint. Two thin lines with stars surrounding them encircled the woman. A thin white outline of the number 4 (for 4th Street, where the building upon which the mural resides), surrounded by a blue flourish pattern, are painted in the upper-left side of the mural. A aqua-blue houndstooth pattern has been painted, again with a stencil in the upper-right corner of the mural.</description>

    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2012</date>
    <description>In this collaborative piece painted by Erik Burke, Kelly Peyton, and Kaitlyn Bryson, a male figure wearing dark blue jeans and a yellow tank top lays on his back in front of a blue background with hands interlaced and resting on his stomach. It appears as though the man is floating. In the bottom-left corner of the mural, circular, triangular, other geometric shapes, and dashes are painted on the man's pants in a shade of blue lighter than the pants and more like that of the background. Similar shapes are painted in marigold yellow on the man's shirt, as are figures fashioned out of the letters &quot;L&quot; and &quot;D&quot; and the number &quot;4&quot; (L4, D4); these figures represent the phrase &quot;Live for What You Would Die For.&quot; These figures, and the phrase they represent, likely relate to the theme and purpose of the mural, referred to by one if its painters, Burke, as a tribute to Beau Shaver of Reno, NV who is also likely the man depicted in the mural. The man also has various shapes (hearts, roses, the outline of a crown) and words painted in yellow on his arm, neck, face and teeth. The background of the right side of the mural is painted in graduated shades of blue (light to dark, from the bottom to the top). An upside down brown hat appears in the lower-right corner of the mural, it has currant-red-outlined-in-yellow flowers sitting on the brim and one flower peaking out from inside. Burke's moniker (OU33), the other two artists' initials (KP and Kb), and the date (2012) are painted in white in the upper-right corner of the mural, with &quot;L4D4 SODC SHAVER&quot; painted below. The mural is 80 x 16 ft. </description>

    <date>2016</date>
    <description>As artist Joe C. Rock explains on his website: &quot;This mural was created as an ode to the history of the Midtown area in Reno, NV.  The word 'Midtown' covers the wall in painted exposed brick, transitioning from new, to worn down, to built back up with metal and brackets, just as the area has [b]een throughout the years. Vintage ads and photographs of [influential] people and businesses, [as well as] imagery that helped build up the area are recreated in spray paint and house paint [and] collaged about in a makeshift timeline of the area [that leads] up to a motel sign from the street, re-lettered to say 'look to the future.' A child adorned in an American-flag dress with Lady Liberty's crown, torch, and tablets looks blindly into the future.&quot;</description>

    <description>This mural painted by artist Joshua Coffy during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017 features a black bear with ryukin goldfish swimming around it. The bottom third of the mural's background is an aegean-blue color, perhaps representative of water, while the rest of the background is tan with chiffon circles (or bubbles). A grid of eleven colors has been painted in the top middle of the mural.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Modern To Vintage, Timeless Fashion, Wild to Mild]; Unknown [Profile of Woman with Pink Rose in Hair]</title>
    <creator>Rock, Joe C.</creator>
    <contributor>LuLu's Chic Boutique; Timeless Fashion Consignment Shop and Bridal Salon</contributor>
    <date>2011; 2013</date>
    <description>This monochromatic mural, originally painted for Lulu's Chic Boutique (now Timeless Fashion Consignment Shop and Bridal Salon) by artist Joe C. Rock, consists of a variety of geometric shapes, designs, patterns, and objects. The top portion of the mural is comprised of black polka dots. Water or mountains (what is actually the hair of a woman painted on the adjacent right or east-facing wall) flows from from the right, rising and then encircling the business logo painted in the center of the wall with the moon rising above it to the left. The logo is flanked on the left by the Eiffel Tower and on the right by the profile of a monocle-wearing man with a curly handlebar mustache whose top hat is the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Centered below the logo is an ornate fleurs-de-lis flanked by botehs (the teardrop-shaped motif with a curved upper end that comprises the paisley pattern). More fleurs-de-lis and botehs, as well as another top-hat-wearing figure, diamonds, various-sized squares, circles/dots, and flourish patterns speckle the left side of the mural. Rock brings a little color into the far-left side of the mural (under the window), where he has painted his moniker and some red dots (a few also appear to the left of and above the window). The right (east-facing) wall features the profile of a woman with red lips and a bright-pink rose in the zebra-pattern-like hair that flows behind her (and into the adjacent wall). She wears a pearl necklace and earrings, and pearls are threaded through her hair. To the right of the woman is a gray, black, white, and bright-red flourish design with botehs (the teardrop-shaped motif with a curved upper end that comprises the paisley pattern). Bright-red polka dots permeate from the design, creating the background of the entire composition. The dots get darker the further away from the design they get, until they eventually turn black.</description>

    <creator>Burke, Erik; Burke, Erik (OverUnder); Bryson, Kaitlyn; Peyton, Kelly;</creator>
    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2012</date>
    <description>In this collaborative piece painted by Erik Burke, Kelly Peyton, and Kaitlyn Bryson, a male figure wearing dark blue jeans and a yellow tank top lays on his back in front of a blue background with hands interlaced and resting on his stomach. It appears as though the man is floating. In the bottom-left corner of the mural, circular, triangular, other geometric shapes, and dashes are painted on the man's pants in a shade of blue lighter than the pants and more like that of the background. Similar shapes are painted in marigold yellow on the man's shirt, as are figures fashioned out of the letters &quot;L&quot; and &quot;D&quot; and the number &quot;4&quot; (L4, D4); these figures represent the phrase &quot;Live for What You Would Die For.&quot; These figures, and the phrase they represent, likely relate to the theme and purpose of the mural, referred to by one if its painters, Burke, as a tribute to Beau Shaver of Reno, NV who is also likely the man depicted in the mural. The man also has various shapes (hearts, roses, the outline of a crown) and words painted in yellow on his arm, neck, face and teeth. The background of the right side of the mural is painted in graduated shades of blue (light to dark, from the bottom to the top). An upside down brown hat appears in the lower-right corner of the mural, it has currant-red-outlined-in-yellow flowers sitting on the brim and one flower peaking out from inside. Burke's moniker (OU33), the other two artists' initials (KP and Kb), and the date (2012) are painted in white in the upper-right corner of the mural, with &quot;L4D4 SODC SHAVER&quot; painted below. The mural is 80 x 16 ft. </description>

    <description>This mural is a three-part piece painted by artist Joe C. Rock. The fence here (of three total) depicts a hand-drawn rudimentary map representing Sparks, Reno, Virginia City and Carson City, Nevada. The sage brush that grows horizontally behind the map peaks through holes in the map and the golden-yellow banner from the Nevada state flag wraps around and through the entire seen. A monochromatic portrait of Kit Carson is painted on the-right side of the fence.</description>

According to Rock, &quot;The faces are [...Therese Curatello and Pete Barnato who starred in...] a Junkee commercial. Painted in a monochrome palette to match the Junkee color scheme, their silhouettes alternate toward the center encasing objects, [which are] fonts and patterns representative of items found in Junkee&quot; (http://www.joecrockart.com).</description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>The theme of the mural on this detached garage, painted by Joe C. Rock, relates to its location behind Marmot Properties, one of the foremost real estate development companies in Reno, particularly active in the Midtown area. The entire structure is painted bright green. On the front of the garage is the head of a person with their hair covering their face, their right hand cups the lower part of their face. Reno's downtown skyline comprises the top of the head with Mount Rose at its apex. A red and gold crown (a common object in Rock's murals) with a halo of barbed wire floats above the head. On the garage door, the words &quot;The Heart of the City&quot;(with a heart above the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;city&quot;) are painted over the head in red with a neon-green outline. Pink hearts appear on the portion of the letters that extend past the head, and the portion covering the head is transparent, revealing imagery behind it. The door is framed by branches of sagebrush and the shadows they cast. &quot;The Heart of the City&quot; might symbolize the centrality of the Midtown district in the greater Reno area, both geographically and culturally. On the east-facing wall of the garage is a monochromatic scene of three marmots behind some plants with the words &quot;Things Change&quot; painted in white over the scene. A crown hangs over the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;things.&quot; The words are transparent and reveal what is behind them, except the &quot;thi&quot; in &quot;things,&quot; which reveal a house and fence. The marmots on this wall represent Marmot Properties, while &quot;Things Change&quot; and the house and fence scene contained in the &quot;thi&quot; gestures towards Marmot's role in transforming the area's landscape, demography and culture through their development activities.</description>

    <description>The two roller doors of the Reno Fire Department station in downtown Reno each depict different fire helmets. On the right door is a black leather (likely) helmet with a brass eagle adornment affixed to the top of the helmet that secures a leather shield that reads &quot;Reno Fire Firefighter Truck 1&quot; to the front helmet front. The crown (an object that appears in many of Rock's murals) on the eagle's head is not found on actual helmets. Smoke emerges from behind the helmet. In the lower-right corner of the door is a monochromatic scene depicting a firefighter manning the deluge gun on top of a fire engine. On the left third of the door is another monochromatic scene depicting one of two firefighters (or one split in half by the wall between the two doors) fully suited up and wearing a helmet with respirator while three people climb a ladder in the background to the right.</description>

    <contributor>The Melting Pot World Emporium &amp; Smoke Shop</contributor>
    <date>2015</date>
    <description>This mural depicts a large brown octopus mixed with peacock feathers and a human-like figure. The octopus is the focus of the mural. The body of the octopus is painted in a palette of browns, while its suckers are painted in a palette of blue. The peacock feathers almost resemble the suckers as they intertwine into the octopus's tentacles. The tentacles wrap around and burst through a portrait of a blue human-like figure wearing headphones that emerges from the mud-cracked ground, perhaps representing Burning Man since the business upon which the mural is painted, The Melting Pot World Emporium, is one of the leading retailers of Playa gear in the area. The figure stares out into the distance. A tentacle bursts through the middle portrait, which depicts the Burning Man logo centered in the Burning-Man-Playa landscape with planets hanging in the night sky above. The last portrait is a circus-style wall sign for the The Melting Pot. A curtain opens up to a stage with silhouettes of people dancing in front of an earth with sun rays around it. The background of the entire mural is painted a bright red, contrasting the aquatic and desert ambiance of the subject matter. </description>

    <description>This monochromatic mural set against a light blue background depicts a camera with a roll of film unraveling from its film compartment. On the unraveled film can be seen the undeveloped images that the camera has captured. A girl holds her dog; a man hangs out the driver-side window of a van and looks at the camera; a man kneels in front of his bicycle; two children ride their bicycles; a man looks to his left with a city street behind him; a man holds two bags (one in each hand) up in the air and smiles at the camera; a woman stands with her hands in her pockets and smiles at the camera; a young girl looks quizzically at the camera; a young man looks back at the camera from the driver-side window of his car; a man stands with his hands in his pockets in front of a light pole; a man with a thick mustache looks directly at the camera, a skull-like object is to the left of him; four children sit together on some steps; a young girl rides a rocking horse. The film roll ends, leading into an orange burst and then beam of light that perhaps represents the light needed to expose the film. The light beam is surrounded by black, blue, and gray clouds.     </description>

    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits. This portrait is of Frederic DeLongchamps, one of Nevada's most prolific architects. The buildings on top of DeLonghamps' head symbolize his career as an architect.</description>

    <description>This monochromatic mural set against a light blue background depicts a camera with a roll of film unraveling from its film compartment. On the unraveled film can be seen the undeveloped images that the camera has captured. A girl holds her dog; a man hangs out the driver-side window of a van and looks at the camera; a man kneels in front of his bicycle; two children ride their bicycles; a man looks to his left with a city street behind him; a man holds two bags (one in each hand) up in the air and smiles at the camera; a woman stands with her hands in her pockets and smiles at the camera; a young girl looks quizzically at the camera; a young man looks back at the camera from the driver-side window of his car; a man stands with his hands in his pockets in front of a light pole; a man with a thick mustache looks directly at the camera, a skull-like object is to the left of him; four children sit together on some steps; a young girl rides a rocking horse. The film roll ends, leading into an orange burst and then beam of light that perhaps represents the light needed to expose the film. The light beam is surrounded by black, blue, and gray clouds.     </description>

    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>A fluid mural is painted by artist Joe C. Rock on this three-sided fence. The mural begins with the head of a woman in front of clouds whose hair then flows throughout the mural, as do the clouds. An array of subject matter appear among the hair and clouds over a light-blue background. While some figures portray recognizable figures, such as dice, eye balls, power lines, butterflies, rain drops, a bee, a rose, a mountain range, and botehs (the teardrop-shaped motif with a curved upper end that comprises the paisley pattern), other subjects and figures are more abstract, or focus on written text. </description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>According to artist Joe C. Rock, his mural on the exterior wall of the Renaissance Reno Downtown Hotel &quot;depicts imagery of Reno and the greater-Nevada area. The octagon 'R' is from the second Reno arch that ran from 1963-1987 [and] the background is filled with sage, our state flower. The 'E' is filled with a mountain bluebird, our state bird. The 'N' is inside a silver state of Nevada with a portrait of Jesse Reno, our city's namesake. The 'O' is from the current Reno arch [and sits over] a heart, inside the 'O' is a landscape of Mt. Rose surrounded by a red rose. The piece is finished off with the words 'Home Means Nevada,' our state song&quot; (https://www.instagram.com/p/BUS8FaqDbF4/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=joecrock13).  </description>

    <description>This mural is a three-part piece painted by artist Joe C. Rock. The two fences here (of three total) converge into a nautical star with monochromatic portraits of Jesse Lee Reno to the left and John Sparks to the right. Sage brush grows horizontally from each man's face. On the far-right end of the right (Sparks) side of the fence is a depiction of the Nevada bicentennial coin. Barbed wire winds around the sagebrush on this side of the fence, and the golden-yellow banner from the Nevada state flag wraps around flows through the entire scene.</description>

    <date>2013</date>
    <description>This mural, originally painted for Lulu's Chic Boutique (now Timeless Fashion Consignment Shop and Bridal Salon) by artist Joe C. Rock, features the profile of a woman with red lips and a bright-pink rose in the zebra-pattern-like hair that flows behind her (and into the adjacent wall). She wears a pearl necklace and earrings, and pearls are threaded through her hair. To the right of the woman is a gray, black, white, and bright-red flourish design with botehs (the teardrop-shaped motif with a curved upper end that comprises the paisley pattern). Bright-red polka dots permeate from the design, creating the background of the entire composition. The dots get darker the further away from the design they get, until they eventually turn black.</description>

    <title>In the Midst of Midtown</title>
    <creator>Rock, Joe C.</creator>
    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>As artist Joe C. Rock explains on his website: &quot;This mural was created as an ode to the history of the Midtown area in Reno, NV.  The word 'Midtown' covers the wall in painted exposed brick, transitioning from new, to worn down, to built back up with metal and brackets, just as the area has [b]een throughout the years. Vintage ads and photographs of [influential] people and businesses, [as well as] imagery that helped build up the area are recreated in spray paint and house paint [and] collaged about in a makeshift timeline of the area [that leads] up to a motel sign from the street, re-lettered to say 'look to the future.' A child adorned in an American-flag dress with Lady Liberty's crown, torch, and tablets looks blindly into the future.&quot;</description>

    <date>2012</date>
    <description>The back side of this signal box painted by Vaka features young child riding a sheep or, mutton busting. The boy wears a large beige cowboy hat, a blue shirt with white dots, a gray vest with the letter &quot;A&quot; in black over a yellow circle, and blue jeans. Pennies have been glued (not by the artist) to the child's and sheep's eyes and the child's nostrils. The theme of this signal box relates to its proximity to the Reno Livestock Events Center, the venue for the Reno Rodeo.</description>

    <date>2013</date>
    <description>This 65 x (roughly) 16 foot mural pinated on the wall of Peerless Cleaners by artist Erik Burke combines Reno history and Nevada mountain ranges. The mural is speckled with small symbols that depict prominent Reno figures, organizations, and locations in the business's and city's history. Some of these symbols are connected, like constellations, by a line that carries throughout the composition. The mountain-range landscape can also be interpreted as draped fabric, connecting the mural to the the business located in that building. The mural is painted in shades of red, orange, yellow, blue and white.</description>

    <description>At 28 x 140 ft., Erik Burke's mural, Camouflage, is the largest painted during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017. The mural abstracts images such as a pioneer woman on riding a horse, cacti, and sheep that represent Nevada's historical past as well as its promising future. The top of the mural reads &quot;Look to the Pasture to see the Future,&quot; conveying the influence that the natural landscape, farming and ranching has had in this state.</description>

    <contributor>Blum Reno</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits, spanning the entire 250 x 20 foot mural. The portraits, from left to right, are as follows: Frederic DeLongchamps, one of Nevada's most prolific architects; Dot So La Lee, a basket weaver and member of the northwestern Nevada Washoe; Wovoka, a Paiute religious leader; Ben Palmer, one of the original settlers of and most successful ranchers in the Carson Valley; Michael Heizer, a contemporary artist whose life-long project, City, is &quot;the largest piece of contemporary art ever attempted&quot; (http://doublenegative.tarasen.net/city/)&quot;; Jeanne Wier, founder of the Nevada Historical Society; Abraham Lincoln, whose re-election in 1864 was largely due to Nevada's expedited entry into statehood; Jack Johnson, who, after winning a bout against James Jeffries in Reno, NV in 1910, became the first African American world heavyweight boxing champion; Sarah Winnemucca, a Northern Paiute activist from Nevada; and Mark Twain, who lived and wrote for a newspaper in Virginia City and Carson City, NV in the early 1860s. Each portrait contains a detail pertaining to the individual, for example: buildings on top of DeLonghamps' head; a basket behind the top of Dot So La Lee's head; a brand surrounded by barbed wire on top of Palmer's head; Heizer wears a hat that appears sculpted from metal to symbolize his work as a sculptor; a rendering of the Nevada Historical Society in the broach pinned to Weir's collar; the US Highway sign imposed on Lincoln's head is symbolic of his namesake, US Route 40; a rendering of Johnson knocking Jeffries out during the championship bout; and the top of Twain's head represented as an open book, and a quill pen over his right shoulder. </description>

    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2014</date>
    <description>This signal box is covered in white birch trees. Artist Clarissa Stephens painted the birches, with their characteristic white bark marked with long, horizontal lenticels (lines), against a background of nearly the same color, using a slightly more gray tone of white and a shading technique to make the birches pop against the white background. A few golden-yellow leaves appear on the tips of some of the birches' branches.</description>

    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>This mural depicts the profile of a man with a beard, wearing glasses, holding a skull in his hand painted against a half blue (horizontally) red and half sky-background. The man's hair and the back of his head are comprised of: part cloudy blue sky with white swans flying across it, part water with dark-blue fish swimming in it. Large, bright-pink flowers emerge from the bottom-left corner of the mural, getting smaller as they cross the top of the skull and finally speckle the red background between the skull and man's face.</description>

    <description>This mural is a three-part piece painted by artist Joe C. Rock. The two fences here (of three total) converge into a nautical star with monochromatic portraits of Jesse Lee Reno to the left and John Sparks to the right. Sage brush grows horizontally from each man's face. On the left (Reno) side of the fence, Nevada's nickname/slogan &quot;Battle Born&quot; is painted in black along the length of the fence, against a rich blue background. A mountain bluebird perches on the sagebrush in front of the &quot;B&quot; in &quot;Born.&quot; The golden-yellow banner from the Nevada state flag wraps around flows through the entire scene. On the far-right end of the right (Sparks) side of the fence is a depiction of the Nevada bicentennial coin. Barbed wire winds around the sagebrush on this side of the fence, and the golden-yellow banner from the Nevada state flag wraps around flows through the entire scene.</description>

    <description>&quot;DAYDREAM!&quot; appears in all caps in this mural that artist Joe C. Rock painted on a chain link fence with wood slats. Enclosed within the block letters is green grass against a blue skyline. The letters are outlined in white and cast red shadows outlined in peach. Growing out of the grass in the first &quot;D&quot; is a blue flower. A butterfly with blue wings perches on the outside edge of the second &quot;D&quot; and a lady bug crawls across the grass. A red rose rests on the left side of the &quot;R.&quot; A worm slithers through the grass, straddling the right side of the &quot;R&quot; and left side of the &quot;E,&quot; disappearing and re-emerging out of the right side of the &quot;E.&quot; A blue flower with a lady bug on it grows out of the grass in the dot of the exclamation point.</description>

    <creator>Angelina, Christina</creator>
    <contributor>Shapiro, Aric; Burke, Erik; Whitney Peak Hotel;</contributor>
    <date>2015</date>
    <description>Christina Angelina's mural, painted during the Inaugural Reno Sculpture Fest in 2015, features a young female figure wearing a dark grey hood over her long wavy black hair. She looks directly at the viewer, and holds a silver frame against her body. The mural was painted using a palette of blues, grays, silver and black and using a technique wherein the paint streams down from the very top of the mural to create movement in the composition. Due to the mural's considerably large scale (approximately 35 x 80 ft.), spanning the entire height of a seven-story parking garage, the young woman seems to look down upon or watch over the downtown-Reno area. After being told by a homeless man in Reno that the young woman is his angel, Angelina said: &quot;That people sleep under this artwork to feel safer downtown [m]akes me like this piece even more&quot; (https://www.instagram.com/p/BUx2SQUlhIj/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=starfightera).  </description>

    <description>Artist Hernan Borrero paints an animated bindle-carrying dog smoking in front of an idle motel located in the southwestern desert, suggested by the magenta cacti. The mural is painted in shades of green, pink, purple, yellow, black, and brown. Bryce Chisholm's mural features a a vibrant multicolored background. A young woman on the right and a wolf below her on the left have been painted over the background using a stencil (a technique the artist is known for) and black and white paint. Two thin lines with stars surrounding them encircled the woman. A thin white outline of the number 4 (for 4th Street, where the building upon which the mural resides), surrounded by a blue flourish pattern, are painted in the upper-left side of the mural. A aqua-blue houndstooth pattern has been painted, again with a stencil in the upper-right corner of the mural.</description>

    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Nevada or Nevada Row is a collaborative mural by artists Joe C. Rock and Erik Burke that showcases &quot;...people who made a significant impression on Nevada through unconventional ways. Portraits in blue (the color of the Nevada flag) represent Nevada natives and warm-toned portraits represent outsiders that accomplished something significant in or for Nevada&quot; (eriktburke.com). A wooden arrow with a black obsidian arrowhead runs right to left behind the portraits. The portraits is of Jack Johnson who, after winning a bout against James Jeffries in Reno, NV in 1910, became the first African American world heavyweight boxing champion. Above his head is a rendering of Johnson knocking Jeffries out during the championship bout.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Birch Trees]</title>
    <creator>Stephens, Clarissa</creator>
    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2014</date>
    <description>This signal box is covered in white birch trees. Artist Clarissa Stephens painted the birches, with their characteristic white bark marked with long, horizontal lenticels (lines), against a background of nearly the same color, using a slightly more gray tone of white and a shading technique to make the birches pop against the white background. A few golden-yellow leaves appear on the tips of some of the birches' branches.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Headquarters Bar Crawl Mural]</title>
    <creator>UTI Crew; Spek;</creator>
    <contributor>Art Spot Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>The theme of this vibrant mural, painted by members of UTI Crew during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, directly relates to the location in which it is painted: the wall of Headquarters Bar, a bar owned and operated by &quot;Crawl Reno, the organizers of the Reno Zombie Crawl and a ton of other massive parties in downtown Reno&quot; (http://headquartersreno.com/#home_about). On the right side of the mural stands a man with characteristics representative of the various crawls that take place in Reno throughout the year. The red Santa hat he wears with gold polka dots and a gold fur ball gestures towards the Santa Crawl; his green beard gestures towards the Leprechaun Crawl; and the Superman shirt he wears gestures towards the Super Hero Crawl. On the left side of the mural is a zombie with a mask resting on the top of its head, representing both the Zombie and Mardi Gras Crawls. These two figures flank four separate graffiti-style words (one of which appears to be the moniker of one of the UTI Crew members, Spek). In the background of the mural, a city skyline goes up in flames, perhaps caused by the man on the left who holds a lit match in his right hand, a mug of bear in his left. To the left of the mural is a small chain link fence with wood slats upon which &quot;The Crawl&quot; is painted in aqua, turquoise and sky blue horror font against a yellow and orange background with red splatters. </description>

Green, peach, salmon, lavender, and blue geometric shapes float from behind the stature, against a dark purple background, and upside down bronze-colored fleurs-de-lis (perhaps suggesting that the statue is of French origin) speckle a slate-blue background in the upper-right corner of the mural.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Reno is Rad]</title>
    <creator>Lucido, Michael</creator>
    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Michael Lucido's electric-box mural features two sunglass-wearing raccoons on the back. A raccoon holding a video camera in its right hand while flashing a &quot;sign of the horns&quot; gesture (the index finger and the little finger are upright and the thumb is clasped against the two middle fingers) on his left hand sits atop the shoulders of the other raccoon who is performing a kick flip on a sky-blue skateboard with pink wheels, the words &quot;Rad Thief&quot; (a reference to the name of Lucido's clothing company: Rad Thief) appear on the bottom of the board (&quot;Rad Thief&quot; also appears on the video camera). The raccoons are painted against a teal, yellow, and pink background. Three smaller boxes (one blue, one yellow, one pink) sit to the left of the main box. The skateboarding theme of this box possibly relates to its location at City Park Plaza, used in the past as an unofficial skate park. The video camera might be symbolic Lucido's involvement with multi-media production. </description>

    <description>The front side of Arthur Richmond's signal-box mural features a colorful hummingbird whose red beak wraps around to the left side of the box and ends in a fountain-pen tip. The bird's head is dark blue and green, the green carries into the top of the bird's wing that then transitions to dark brown. The bird's back is light brown, and its breast is light purple, light blue, light green, yellow, brown and white. The bird is perched on the branch of what appears to be a birch tree. What the bird is looking at is reflected in its pupil, which is surrounded by a golden-yellow iris. The bird is painted against a white background at the top of the box that transitions to deep orange at the bottom of the box.</description>

    <description>The front side of this signal box painted by Vaka features a rodeo clown. White circles are painted around the clown's eyes and mouth and red appear around his nose and upper lip. A headset microphone sits in front of the clown's mouth, worn under a white cowboy hat with red trim. The clown's neck is adorned with a red neckerchief, worn above a blue shirt. Behind the clown is a multicolored background speckled with yellow, blue, red and green handprints. The word &quot;Reno&quot; is painted in white over a black backdrop in the lower-right corner of the box. The theme of this signal box relates to its proximity to the Reno Livestock Events Center, the venue for the Reno Rodeo.</description>

    <description>A vibrant yellow, orange, and red coyote sitting in front of a bronze moon rising amid a monochromatic sky and mountain range comprised of various shapes, patterns and objects is the focal point of this mural painted by Kelly Peyton on a 16 x 20 ft. panel of the Nevada Fine Arts wall. Hearts, lighting bolts, fish skeletons and some words disguise themselves in the coyote's fur.</description>

    <title>In the Midst of Midtown</title>
    <creator>Rock, Joe C.</creator>
    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>As artist Joe C. Rock explains on his website: &quot;This mural was created as an ode to the history of the Midtown area in Reno, NV.  The word 'Midtown' covers the wall in painted exposed brick, transitioning from new, to worn down, to built back up with metal and brackets, just as the area has [b]een throughout the years. Vintage ads and photographs of [influential] people and businesses, [as well as] imagery that helped build up the area are recreated in spray paint and house paint [and] collaged about in a makeshift timeline of the area [that leads] up to a motel sign from the street, re-lettered to say 'look to the future.' A child adorned in an American-flag dress with Lady Liberty's crown, torch, and tablets looks blindly into the future.&quot;</description>

    <description>This mural by Erik Burke was painted on an aluminum garage door using a color palette consisting of white, gray and black, and various shades of blue, green, red and brown. The garage door has been painted lead gray and each square of the individual raised panels are painted in one of seven alternating colors: cinnamon brown, hickory brown, sea-foam green, teal blue, stone blue, cerulean blue, and navy blue. The petals of the poppy in the foreground were created using candy, crimson, cherry, and mahogany red. The curvy stem is a painted using sapphire, cerulean and aegean blue, shaded with gray and highlighted with yellow and light green. A partially crushed coca-cola can appears in the center of the mural, painted over a portion of the stem. The poppy appears to emerge from under a gray roller-style garage door, with the outline of an alien head painted on it in red. The mural is 20 x 8 ft.</description>

    <creator>Lucido, Michael</creator>
    <contributor>City of Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Artist Michael Lucido's electric-box mural depicts a food truck driven and manned by raccoons serving skateboards. The front side portrays the back or non-service side of the food truck. The skateboard-food-truck theme of this box possibly relates to its location at City Park Plaza, used in the past as an unofficial skate park, and to the food-truck culture that has developed in the area over the past several years.</description>

    <description>This signal-box mural by Devin Hosselkus is Reno themed.

Hosselkus used a simple color palette consisting of navy blue, teal, red, tan and brown, grey, white, and black.</description>

    <date>2013</date>
    <description>This 65 x (roughly) 16 foot mural pinated on the wall of Peerless Cleaners by artist Erik Burke combines Reno history and Nevada mountain ranges. The mural is speckled with small symbols that depict prominent Reno figures, organizations, and locations in the business's and city's history. Some of these symbols are connected, like constellations, by a line that carries throughout the composition. The mountain-range landscape can also be interpreted as draped fabric, connecting the mural to the the business located in that building. The mural is painted in shades of red, orange, yellow, blue and white.</description>

    <creator>Burke, Erik; Burke, Erik (OverUnder);</creator>
    <contributor>Nevada Museum of Art</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>This mural was painted by artist Erik Burke on a cinderblock trash-can enclosure located behind the Nevada Museum of Art (NMA) to coincide with the Tilted Basin Exhibition that ran at the NMA from August through October of 2016. The entire enclose was painted in a vibrant lime green and the male and female figures represented horizontally on the left side, presumably a father and daughter dancing, are painted on top of the lime-green background using darker shades of green and black paint. Dark-green paint was used to create a cat-like design on the portion of the girl's dress that covers her arms, shoulders and upper back, and to create a simple floral pattern on the remaining (lower) portion of the dress. A bit a of white paint was used to create the metal appearance of the man's wedding band and to paint Burke's moniker (OU37) in the upper-left corner. According to the NMA website, the Tilted Basin Exhibition &quot;bridges the divide between Northern and Southern Nevada communities and provides a wide-ranging overview and understanding of the most accomplished work being created by more than thirty artists living and working in Nevada today.&quot;</description>

    <description>The southern wall of Jub Jub's Thirst parlor contains six panels, each painted by a different artist. From left to right: The profile of a man resembling (or perhaps who is) James Brown belting out a tune is the subject of this mural by artist Joe C. Rock. The words &quot;Funk,&quot;&quot;Rock,&quot;&quot;Soul,&quot; and &quot;Style,&quot; as well as music notes emerge from and float out of his coifed hair; An armor-clad romanesque statue with severed fingers on its left hand stands on the left side of this mural. Green, peach, salmon, lavender, and blue geometric shapes float from behind the stature, against a dark purple background and upside down bronze-colored fleurs-de-lis (perhaps suggesting that the statue is of French origin) speckle a slate-blue background in the upper-right corner of the mural; Late-rapper TuPac Shakur appears in front a the Los Angeles skyline wearing a red bandana tied around his head, a Detroit Red Wings jersey, and a gold chain and watch.

    <description>Each side of Bryce Chisholm's signal box portrays a distinct image. On the left side, Chisholm painted this &quot;Super Boy&quot; using white, black, and red paint and a stencil (a technique he is known for). Outfitted in a red and black cape and mask, with a star emblazoned on his chest, the boy strikes a heroic pose as an aqua-blue and black (stencil painted) moon emerges over the boy from the vibrant yellow background. Purple and teal roots can be seen growing below the boy's feet. A halo-like object has been painted with white paint (and a stencil) over the boy's head.</description>

    <date>2017</date>
    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock depicts a cowboy riding a wild mustang into the sunset, representative of the Reno Rodeo, in this mural painted during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October, 2017. A halo of barbed wire floats above the cowboy's hat and a locomotive disguises itself in the body of the mustang. The background is painted bright blue with a beige banner swirling across it that reads &quot;Get Buck Get Broke.&quot; Objects, such as grape bundles, crowns (a common object in Rock's murals), hearts and cherries speckle the mural's background.</description>

    <description>This signal box is covered in white birch trees. Artist Clarissa Stephens painted the birches, with their characteristic white bark marked with long, horizontal lenticels (lines), against a background of nearly the same color, using a slightly more gray tone of white and a shading technique to make the birches pop against the white background. A few golden-yellow leaves appear on the tips of some of the birches' branches.</description>

    <description>This monochromatic mural set against a light blue background depicts a camera with a roll of film unraveling from its film compartment. On the unraveled film can be seen the undeveloped images that the camera has captured. A girl holds her dog; a man hangs out the driver-side window of a van and looks at the camera; a man kneels in front of his bicycle; two children ride their bicycles; a man looks to his left with a city street behind him; a man holds two bags (one in each hand) up in the air and smiles at the camera; a woman stands with her hands in her pockets and smiles at the camera; a young girl looks quizzically at the camera; a young man looks back at the camera from the driver-side window of his car; a man stands with his hands in his pockets in front of a light pole; a man with a thick mustache looks directly at the camera, a skull-like object is to the left of him; four children sit together on some steps; a young girl rides a rocking horse. The film roll ends, leading into an orange burst and then beam of light that perhaps represents the light needed to expose the film. The light beam is surrounded by black, blue, and gray clouds.   </description>

    <creator>Burke, Erik; Burke, Erik (OverUnder)</creator>
    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2013</date>
    <description>This mural painted by artist Erik Burke embraces the history of Nevada. Similar to his other murals, this work is composed of two elements: a landscape, and the words &quot;GO WEST.&quot; The landscape depicts the variety of mountain ranges in Nevada, suggested by the variety of color (shades of red and blue) in which they are painted. The landscape also portrays a wild mustang, an animal representative of Nevada's &quot;wild west&quot; nature and reputation. On the right side of the mural appears a female figure holding a lantern, as if guiding the horse, and throwing into relief the words &quot;GO WEST.&quot; The words are painted in a subtle yellow and white that merges them into the landscape. The lines in between the words, which depict birch trees with Basque tree carvings that are found in the state, weave in front of and behind the mustang and run parallel (and in some cases line up directly with) the building behind the mural (the Silver Legacy Hotel &amp; Casino), further connecting the mural to the city.</description>

    <date>2015</date>
    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock combines United States history with the history of Nevada in this mural that was commissioned to celebrate the Historic Lincoln Highway. Abraham Lincoln appears on the left side of the mural, leading to the Nevada flag and then U.S. flag, over which the words &quot;LINCOLN HIGHWAY&quot; are painted in different font styles and are flanked by the Nevada flag and the Interstate 40 highway sign. All subjects combined, this mural conveys the relevance of this president and his namesake highway. </description>

    <description>This painted-wall sign welcomes those driving past it to Dickerson Road, an area west of downtown Reno, running parallel to the Truckee River, that is referred to as &quot;'Reno’s Industrial Arts District,' combining art, commercial and residential properties, and a nature preserve.&quot; Using bright and vibrant colors, Eric (Erik) Burke and Buz Rhodes painted large block letters, with orange and red shadows behind them, to spell out &quot;Dickerson,&quot; with imagery and scenes appearing in each letter that signify and represent the nature of the district. The &quot;D&quot; features an angle grinder cutting metal; a paint brush stands in for the &quot;I&quot;; the &quot;C&quot; features the profile of half of a sandwich; the &quot;K&quot; displays a smith forging a piece of metal; the &quot;E&quot; shows someone wearing tan pants and brown boots laying under the hood of a vehicle; the &quot;R&quot; features a woman's body in profile from her lower torso to the top of her knees, wearing a black and white striped undergarment, with red rose vines over the entire image; the &quot;S&quot; contains water with green and purple lily pads floating on top; the &quot;O&quot; is made up of a figure wearing tan garments throwing on a yellow pottery wheel; and the &quot;N&quot; includes a variety of multicolored metal bottle caps. The words &quot;Welcome to&quot; and &quot;Live, Work, Eat, Play&quot; appear in red and blue on a white banner painted on the left side of the mural. The artists' names,&quot;Eric Burke and Buz Rhodes,&quot; appear in red and blue on a white banner painted in the upper far-right corner of the mural. </description>

    <date>2000-2017</date>
    <description>A fluid mural is painted by artist Joe C. Rock on this three-sided fence. The mural begins with the head of a woman in front of clouds whose hair then flows throughout the mural, as do the clouds. An array of subject matter appear among the hair and clouds over a light-blue background. While some figures portray recognizable figures, such as dice, eye balls, power lines, butterflies, rain drops, a bee, a rose, a mountain range, and botehs (the teardrop-shaped motif with a curved upper end that comprises the paisley pattern), other subjects and figures are more abstract, or focus on written text. </description>

    <title>Unknown [Octopus, Peacock Feathers, Futuristic Head]</title>
    <creator>Pittman, Adam (Naem); Pittman, Adam;</creator>
    <contributor>The Melting Pot World Emporium &amp; Smoke Shop</contributor>
    <date>2015</date>
    <description>This mural depicts a large brown octopus mixed with peacock feathers and a human-like figure. The octopus is the focus of the mural. The body of the octopus is painted in a palette of browns, while its suckers are painted in a palette of blue. The peacock feathers almost resemble the suckers as they intertwine into the octopus's tentacles. The tentacles wrap around and burst through a portrait of a blue human-like figure wearing headphones that emerges from the mud-cracked ground, perhaps representing Burning Man since the business upon which the mural is painted, The Melting Pot World Emporium, is one of the leading retailers of Playa gear in the area. The figure stares out into the distance. A tentacle bursts through the middle portrait, which depicts the Burning Man logo centered in the Burning-Man-Playa landscape with planets hanging in the night sky above. The last portrait is a circus-style wall sign for the The Melting Pot. A curtain opens up to a stage with silhouettes of people dancing in front of an earth with sun rays around it. The background of the entire mural is painted a bright red, contrasting the aquatic and desert ambiance of the subject matter. </description>

    <contributor>NA</contributor>
    <date>2012</date>
    <description>Artist Erik Burke paints a sitting human figure with yellow, peach, orange and white skin comprised of puzzle pieces holding a roller door with the outline of a house painted on it close to his/her body. The door covers most of the figure, including his/her face. Also held against the body, in front of the door, is a lime green chain attached to a turquoise foam finger displaying the &quot;&quot;Sign of the Horns&quot;&quot; gesture. A set of red and white die attached to a silver ball chain hang from the pinky finger of the foam finger. To the right of this, a dark orange and peach block arrow with a dumbbell and arrow with feathers inside of it emerges from three concentric triangles in different shades of green from which a gold alligator mouth emerges. From this mouth comes a peach-outlined-in-dark-orange text bubble with a curly-cue tail that says &quot;&quot;ND'A OU33&quot;&quot;(OU33 being Burke's moniker). Above the mouth, the word &quot;&quot;Flyge&quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;Flyce&quot;&quot; is depicted with real rocks glued to an aqua blue banner-like background.</description>

    <date>2016</date>
    <description>As artist Joe C. Rock explains on his website: &quot;This mural was created as an ode to the history of the Midtown area in Reno, NV.  The word 'Midtown' covers the wall in painted exposed brick, transitioning from new, to worn down, to built back up with metal and brackets, just as the area has [b]een throughout the years. Vintage ads and photographs of [influential] people and businesses, [as well as] imagery that helped build up the area are recreated in spray paint and house paint [and] collaged about in a makeshift timeline of the area [that leads] up to a motel sign from the street, re-lettered to say 'look to the future.' A child adorned in an American-flag dress with Lady Liberty's crown, torch, and tablets looks blindly into the future.&quot;</description>

    <description>Four different-colored, equally-sized squares (clockwise from the top left: green, blue, red, yellow) are painted against a solid-black wall. Along the bottom of the wall, below and in front of the red and yellow squares, the downtown Reno skyline has been depicted with a white outline over black paint. Above the skyline and in the middle of the four squares, a colored portrait of downtown Reno with depictions of the various iterations of the arches has been painted on what was once a plain white piece of paper like those floating around the portrait and composition. &quot;Reno Paint Mart&quot; and paint drops in a variety of colors appear in the upper-right corner of the mural. *The other pieces of paper are slowly being painted to depict other scenes relating to Reno. This was the progress at the time of this photograph.</description>

    <title>Unknown [Beau Shaver Tribute]</title>
    <creator>Burke, Erik; Burke, Erik (OverUnder); Bryson, Kaitlyn; Peyton, Kelly;</creator>
    <contributor>Unknown</contributor>
    <date>2012</date>
    <description>In this collaborative piece painted by Erik Burke, Kelly Peyton, and Kaitlyn Bryson, a male figure wearing dark blue jeans and a yellow tank top lays on his back in front of a blue background with hands interlaced and resting on his stomach. It appears as though the man is floating. In the bottom-left corner of the mural, circular, triangular, other geometric shapes, and dashes are painted on the man's pants in a shade of blue lighter than the pants and more like that of the background. Similar shapes are painted in marigold yellow on the man's shirt, as are figures fashioned out of the letters &quot;L&quot; and &quot;D&quot; and the number &quot;4&quot; (L4, D4); these figures represent the phrase &quot;Live for What You Would Die For.&quot; These figures, and the phrase they represent, likely relate to the theme and purpose of the mural, referred to by one if its painters, Burke, as a tribute to Beau Shaver of Reno, NV who is also likely the man depicted in the mural. The man also has various shapes (hearts, roses, the outline of a crown) and words painted in yellow on his arm, neck, face and teeth. The background of the right side of the mural is painted in graduated shades of blue (light to dark, from the bottom to the top). An upside down brown hat appears in the lower-right corner of the mural, it has currant-red-outlined-in-yellow flowers sitting on the brim and one flower peaking out from inside. Burke's moniker (OU33), the other two artists' initials (KP and Kb), and the date (2012) are painted in white in the upper-right corner of the mural, with &quot;L4D4 SODC SHAVER&quot; painted below. The mural is 80 x 16 ft. </description>

    <description>Artist Joe C. Rock paints a Mt. Rose-themed mural on this 20 x 50 foot wall. The profiles of two women disguise themselves in roses that transition from orange to mustard yellow to golden yellow and decorate the bottom third of the mural. Two pine cones peak from behind the roses, making way to the idyllic rendering of a snow-capped Mt. Rose against a tranquil blue sky. Sage-green leaves and pine needles, with a lady bug crawling through those in the middle right, frame the top of the mural.</description>

    <creator>Coolidge, Sebastian;</creator>
    <contributor>Art Spot Reno</contributor>
    <date>2017;</date>
    <description>In one of the largest murals painted during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, artist Sebastian Coolidge paints a child's legs lying in a grass field. Across from the child is a lone purple flower that appears to be blown by the wind. Large stems sprout throughout the mural and one intersects the child's blue shoe that has a tiny bee resting on the tip of its upper sole. Above this and slightly to the left, a nose emerges from the grass. A thin yellow worm or caterpillar, with a small purple stone in the shape of a head and face to its left, originates from a leaf on a stem and bounces on the grass and enters the child's left thigh.</description>

    <title>A Sense of Harmony</title>
    <creator>Coolidge, Sebastian;</creator>
    <contributor>Art Spot Reno;</contributor>
    <date>2017;</date>
    <description>In one of the largest murals painted during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, artist Sebastian Coolidge paints a child's legs lying in a grass field. Across from the child is a lone purple flower that appears to be blown by the wind. Large stems sprout throughout the mural and one intersects the child's blue shoe that has a tiny bee resting on the tip of its upper sole. Above this and slightly to the left, a nose emerges from the grass. A thin yellow worm or caterpillar, with a small purple stone in the shape of a head and face to its left, originates from a leaf on a stem and bounces on the grass and enters the child's left thigh.</description>

    <title>A World Away</title>
    <creator>Burke, Erik; Burke, Erik (OverUnder);</creator>
    <contributor>Miguel's Mexican Restaurant</contributor>
    <date>2017</date>
    <description>The theme of Erik Burke's mural, A World Away, relates to Mexican culture and the restaurant upon which it is painted: Miguel's. The entire mural consists of four different walls (two west facing, one south facing, and one north facing), each with its own scene painted on it. A muted greenish blue is carried throughout the background of the entire mural. On the west-facing wall on the left, the naturally occurring door and surround are painted over to appear older and more substantial. In the middle of the wall is a church with a green and blue stone and stucco facade with red trim, and people are gathered outside. To the right of this, a red cactus pear is painted in front of what appears to be a black, white and red striped sarape. As Burke explains on his website, he painted on the middle south-facing wall a &quot;Memorial portrait of Miguel Ribera (original owner and namesake of [the] restaurant) with the phrase 'Out of This World,' [which] represents both his passing, as well as his passion for extra-terrestrial life.&quot; Ribera is painted against a plain brown background on the top half of the wall and brown and black basket-weave-like pattern on the bottom half. &quot;Out of This World&quot; is painted in the muted greenish blue that's carried through the entire mural. Burke's moniker (OU38) is painted in the lower-left corner of the wall. The west-facing wall on the right contains a scene of a woman with braided hair rolling tortillas. Light pink and lavender plumerias with yellow centers are painted in front of the same sarape that appears on the left west-facing wall. Burke's moniker is also painted on the lower-right corner of this wall. The adjacent north-facing wall is painted with thick stripes: brown, yellow, white, red, blue, black, brown, yellow, green. According to Burke, this mural is based on personal photos he took while in Oaxaca and on Diego Rivera's painting, La Molendera.</description>

    <description>Alley Cats, painted by Miami-based artist Fallen Rose during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, depicts cats in several different modes. The cats in each wall are painted in black, but the background is different in each wall. Some walls are multicolored, while some are simplistic or monochromatic.</description>

    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Erik Burke paints vibrant and crisp orange poppy-like flowers with yellow and black centers against a background of steel, deep sky and powder blue leaf-like figures. The silhouette of stems and flowers without petals are cast sporadically throughout the composition, at times intersecting the poppy-like flowers, thus taking on a translucent appearance and revealing details of the poppy-like flowers they intersect. The words &quot;Back in the Day is Now&quot; are painted across the mural in a translucent white, again revealing details of the poppy-like flowers over which they are painted. The starkly-contrasting colors of the mural allow the bright flowers in the foreground to stand out and pop against the more subdued background. The mural is 130 x 24 ft.</description>

    <title>Blueprint of a Mother</title>

    <description>When describing his mural, Portrait of a Mother, artist Erik Burke states: &quot;a woman in profile, a carnation, sagebrush, and Mount Whitney overlay one another. The woman (my wife and new mother) was used as a nurturing figure depicted in rich calming blueprint blue. She tends her flock of sheep patterned across her blouse that rises from Mount Whitney, the highest summit in the contiguous United States and the Sierra Nevada. She is flanked by Nevada's state flower, the wild and ever present sagebrush. An enlarged carnation obscures her head but is aligned in a way to represent the entangled and beautiful workings of the brain. Although the carnation has no direct tie to the area, I chose it because it has long been cultivated by many and varying civilizations for decoration and ceremonial purposes, similar to the contemporary use of murals&quot; (eriktburke.com/Blueprint-of-a-Mother). Burke utilized a simple color palette consisting of: a variety of blue shades for the woman, her shirt, and the mountains (which were also painted using gray, white, and black); pinks and reds for the carnation; dark green for the stem of the carnation and a blueish green for the sagebrush, which extends past the parameters of the main mural and casts a gray shadow. Burke's moniker (OU36) is painted in dark blue at the very top, in the middle of the mural, and his website address (eriktburke.com) is painted in white on the bottom-left corner. The mural, 35 x 80 ft., was painted on the seven-story parking garage of Whitney Peak Hotel, during the Inaugural Sculpture Fest in 2015 in Downtown Reno.</description>

    <description>When describing his mural, Portrait of a Mother, artist Erik Burke states: &quot;a woman in profile, a carnation, sagebrush, and Mount Whitney overlay one another. The woman (my wife and new mother) was used as a nurturing figure depicted in rich calming blueprint blue. She tends her flock of sheep patterned across her blouse that rises from Mount Whitney, the highest summit in the contiguous United States and the Sierra Nevada. She is flanked by Nevada's state flower, the wild and ever present sagebrush. An enlarged carnation obscures her head but is aligned in a way to represent the entangled and beautiful workings of the brain. Although the carnation has no direct tie to the area, I chose it because it has long been cultivated by many and varying civilizations for decoration and ceremonial purposes, similar to the contemporary use of murals&quot; (eriktburke.com/Blueprint-of-a-Mother). Burke utilized a simple color palette consisting of: a variety of blue shades for the woman, her shirt, and the mountains (which were also painted using gray, white, and black); pinks and reds for the carnation; dark green for the stem of the carnation and a blueish green for the sagebrush, which extends past the parameters of the main mural and casts a gray shadow. Burke's moniker (OU36) is painted in dark blue at the very top, in the middle of the mural, and his website address (eriktburke.com) is painted in white on the bottom-left corner. The mural, 35 x 80 ft., was painted on the seven-story parking garage of Whitney Peak Hotel, during the Inaugural Sculpture Fest in 2015 in Downtown Reno.</description>

    <title>Back in the Day is Now</title>
    <creator>Burke, Erik; Burke, Erik (OverUnder);</creator>
    <contributor>Kramer's Midtown</contributor>
    <date>2016</date>
    <description>Erik Burke paints vibrant and crisp orange poppy-like flowers with yellow and black centers against a background of steel, deep sky and powder blue leaf-like figures. The silhouette of stems and flowers without petals are cast sporadically throughout the composition, at times intersecting the poppy-like flowers, thus taking on a translucent appearance and revealing details of the poppy-like flowers they intersect. The words &quot;Back in the Day is Now&quot; are painted across the mural in a translucent white, again revealing details of the poppy-like flowers over which they are painted. The starkly-contrasting colors of the mural allow the bright flowers in the foreground to stand out and pop against the more subdued background. The mural is 130 x 24 ft.</description>

    <description>Day Dream, by Joe C. Rock, is inspired by Reno culture, particularly the popularity of Burning Man. The two central figures are wrapped in an embrace, sporting typical attire for Burning Man. The veil on the head of the figure on the left suggests that the mural might be depicting a &quot;Playa Wedding.&quot; One head morphs into a electrocardiograph line that bleeds into the Nevada mountain ranges. The mural is painted with shades of blue, red, yellow, orange, brown, black, and white.</description>

    <description>Artist Dave Young Kim, who painted this mural during the Inaugural Reno Mural Expo in October of 2017, explains his mural as follows: &quot;Before and during World War II the Japanese army took [hundreds] of thousands of girls, mostly from Korea, China and the Philippines, as sex slaves. These 'comfort women' were often times as young as 13 when they were kidnapped, lured in by promises of debt resolution or work. The smile symbolizes the innocence that was lost, and the pink carnations say we will never forget. The open sign completes the piece. History is only history when it no longer happens. Although legal in the state of Nevada, prostitution is illegal in Reno and Las Vegas [and] yet more than 90% of the profits come from those two cities. The same tactics are used today to lure underage girls into a world they never suspected. There are more slaves today than there ever were in history&quot; (https://www.instagram.com/p/BanqFu7lcpm/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=daveyoungkim).</description>

The smile symbolizes the innocence that was lost, and the pink carnations say we will never forget. The open sign completes the piece. History is only history when it no longer happens. Although legal in the state of Nevada, prostitution is illegal in Reno and Las Vegas [and] yet more than 90% of the profits come from those two cities. The same tactics are used today to lure underage girls into a world they never suspected. There are more slaves today than there ever were in history&quot; (https://www.instagram.com/p/BanqFu7lcpm/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=daveyoungkim).  </description>

    <description>Three children and an instructor playing the piano are the subject of this music-themed mural painted by artist Erik Burke on the 60 x 18 foot northern wall of (what was) Maytan Music Center. The brown-haired boy on the left, wearing a red-patterned shirt, has his disproportionately-sized hands stretched out in front of him, resting above the piano keys. The blond-haired girl wearing a purple shirt with a butterfly on it, places both of her hands flat on the keys and smiles widely. The blond-haired boy on the right, wearing glasses and a red and blue striped shirt, plays the piano with his just two index fingers. A headless adult figure (probably an instructor) wearing a white shirt with a yellow &quot;MM&quot; (Make your Momentum) logo on it stands between the blond-haired girl and boy, his/her hands rest on the keys in the full C Major hand position (gesturing towards the mural's title, C Major 7).</description>
