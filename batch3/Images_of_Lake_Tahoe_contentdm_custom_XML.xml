    <SummaryDescription>Title taken from photograph. Caption on image: This is a view of the Tahoe Keys project. Notice the appearance of the water in the lagoons. Notice also that the exit from the lagoons has been blocked off by a sand bar. This happens every winter. In the past, it has been popular to blame Tahoe Keys for ruining the color of the Lake at the South Shore, but it is very likely that the bulk of the material was coming from subdivision activity farther upstream. Now, however, the Keys operation is cutting into the Upper Truckee River and undoubtedly is causing at least some of the discoloration shown in these pictures. Photograph taken May 14, 1965. This image is part of the Lake Tahoe Area Council photograph collection. The Council was a private, non-political and non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and orderly development of the Lake Tahoe Basin. It sought cooperation between private land owners and governmental agencies to solve basin-wide problems of planning, land use,</SummaryDescription>

    <Title>Lake Tahoe and Ward Creek aerial view, looking  West,  1965</Title>

    <Photographer>Lake Tahoe Area Council</Photographer>

    <SummaryDescription>Caption on image: This is the mouth of Ward Creek in an area where there has been a substantial amount of building going on for some years. In this area above Highway 89 we saw county roads which had been severely damaged by flooding.  The silt from these washed out roads accounts for some of the dirt you see in the Lake.  Some of it probably is coming from John M. Reily's road building activities along Ward Creek. Photograph taken May 14, 1965. This image is part of the Lake Tahoe Area Council photograph collection. The Council was a private, non-political and non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and orderly development of the Lake Tahoe Basin. It sought cooperation between private land owners and governmental agencies to solve basin-wide problems of planning, land use, park and recreation development, pollution control and soil conservation.

    <SummaryDescription>Caption on image: Here's a view of the shallow area at the South end of the Lake. The Upper Truckee and Trout Creek have been depositing silt in the South end of the Lake for thousands of years. There is no way to keep this from happening, but we do not have to accelerate the process by careless construction and poor drainage practices. Photograph taken May 14, 1965. This image is part of the Lake Tahoe Area Council photograph collection. The Council was a private, non-political and non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and orderly development of the Lake Tahoe Basin. It sought cooperation between private land owners and governmental agencies to solve basin-wide problems of planning, land use, park and recreation development, pollution control and soil conservation.

    <SummaryDescription>Photograph of construction on the dam at the outlet of Lake Tahoe. The photograph is identified by Edward B. Scott: In this early 1910's photograph, work progresses on the new Truckee River outlet dam, a cement structure that replaced the log and dirt von Schmidt lake level control. Mule, horse, steam and man power was being used to do the job. Due to contractual complications the modern dam remained unfinished until the fall of 1913 at which time arrangements were made for its completion. Cameraman Harold A. Parker faced northeast toward the Commons of Tahoe City from what was then marshland bordering the south side of the Truckee. Photographic print, 4.5 x 6.5 inches</SummaryDescription>

    <SummaryDescription>The modern shoreline of Lake Tahoe is also an artificial creation, made possible by the new dam at the outlet to the Truckee River.  The dam was completed in 1913, to store water in the lake for downstream users.  The maximum storage allowed raised the lake level six feet beyond its &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;natural&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; outlet of 65,223 feet above sea level.  Seasonal variation in lake level occurred even before water began to be stored there, however, owing to natural cycles of drought affecting the mountain streams that drain into Tahoe.</SummaryDescription>

    <SummaryDescription>The effects of lumbering were dramatically visible in the 1880's when this historical photograph was taken.  Debris from the logging and milling activity created an artificial shoreline at Glenbrook Bay, as tons of sawdust were deposited along the lakeshore.  After the Glenbrook area was logged, &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;only eleven trees were standing as far as the eye could see.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</SummaryDescription>

    <SummaryDescription>Caption on image: This view shows a serious erosion problem which should be corrected.  Chunks of asphalt are breaking off and rolling down toward the Lake and the dirt eroding from this bank undoubtedly contains nutrient chemicals which are not doing the Lake any good.  Further east from the point where this picture was taken, gullies are developing which pose a threat to the highway itself.  Photograph taken May 14, 1965.  This image is part of the Lake Tahoe Area Council photograph collection. The Council was a private, non-political and non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and orderly development of the Lake Tahoe Basin.

    <SummaryDescription>Caption on image: This is another shot of Crystal Shores. Near the top of this picture you can see same fresh fill being pushed into the lake.

This image is part of the Lake Tahoe Area Council photograph collection. The Council was a private, non-political and non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and orderly development of the Lake Tahoe Basin. It sought cooperation between private land owners and governmental agencies to solve basin-wide problems of planning, land use, park and recreation development, pollution control and soil conservation.

    <SummaryDescription>The settlement of the lake's south shore, which includes South Lake Tahoe, California, and adjoining Stateline, is presently the largest community at Tahoe. In the words of environmental historians W. Turrentine Jackson and Donald J. Pisani, the casinos at Tahoe are a &quot;prominent symbol of the selling of the environment.&quot; Harvey's Wagon Wheel Hotel and Casino, on the left in the modern photograph, and Harrah's Tahoe on the right are both high-rise hotels as well as casinos.</SummaryDescription>
