    <title>Reno Arch dedication, Reno, Nevada, October 23, 1926</title>
    <description>Photograph of the dedication ceremony for the Reno Arch, October 1926; photographic print, 7 x 11 inches.  Reno erected its arch, fashioned after California city gateway structures, at the intersection of Commercial Row and Virginia Street to promote the 1927 Nevada Transcontinental Highways Exposition.  The Exposition commemorated the completion of the coast-to-coast motor routes.  Designed by Norman W. Prince and erected by the J.L. Stuart Company of San Francisco, the steel arch cost $5,500.  Light bulbs announced the Exposition and the dates, June 25 to August 1, 1927, and blazing lit torches surrounded the word &quot;Reno.&quot;  Those at the arch dedication on October 23, 1926 included the Nevada and California governors, the Reno mayor and 1,500 Shriners of the San Francisco Islamic Temple who were accompanied by a 400 man marching unit and an 80 piece band.</description>

    <title>Virginia Street and the Reno Arch at night, Reno, Nevada, circa 1934</title>
    <description>Caption on image: &amp;quot;At night. View of Virginia Street and the Reno Arch at night.&amp;quot; Postcard.  Originally erected on Virginia Street in 1926 to promote the Transcontinental Highways Exposition of 1927, the arch originally included        the words &amp;quot;Nevada's Transcontinental Highways Exposition&amp;quot; and the dates of the exposition.  After the exposition, the Reno City Council decided to keep the arch as a permanent downtown gateway, and Mayor E.E. Roberts asked the citizens of Reno to suggest a slogan for the arch.  No acceptable slogan was received until a $100 prize was offered, and G.A. Burns of Sacramento was declared the winner on March 14, 1929 with 'Reno, The Biggest Little City in the World'.</description>
