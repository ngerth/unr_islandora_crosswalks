        <pagetext>SYNOPSIS OF A PAPER UPON  A SUMMER'S EXPLORATION IN THE SIERRA NEVADA.  br                                                                                                                                                  By A. R. CONKLING. br                                                                                                                                                  Our outfitting point was Carson City, Nevada. During the fortnight spent here in preparation, a series of meteorological observations were taken night and day. There is little else besides the Carson mint in the State capital to interest the stranger. We started out for Glenbrook, on Lake Tahoe, on September 15. But Lieutenant Wheeler was not the first comer to this region.  In 1843, Fremont explored here, and left a cannon on the grounds, now owned by Captain Bray. In 1852, McComb surveyed an emigrant road at the foot of the lake. Later still, in 1862, Lieutenant Beckwirth reconnoitered portions of the Sierra Nevada, and in 1874 a coast-survey party did some work. But the first systematic survey of Lake Tahoe and vicinity was begun last year by our party. Flags were put up on prominent points on the lake-shore to be used in the triangulation. Leaving Glenbrook, the party traveled south to Lake Valley, California. At Kearney's, on the boundary of the  Gold   and  Silver  states, it was found that the dividing line ran through the middle of the dining room in the hotel; hence, whoever dines there, may eat in California and Nevada at the same time, by sitting at the middle of the table. The lofty mountains known as Job's Peaks were ascended from Rowland's. The view from the summit is very extensive. The Inyo mountains are seen in the far south, while on the north and west the Sierra Nevada range is visible for more than fifty miles. The lumber trade of this part of California deserves a passing notice. On account of the nearness of the Comstock mines, where vast quantities of timber are constantly required, the dealers find them a good market for their lumber. One operator named Gardner has a contract for sixty millions of logs for the mines. He has four years to fill it, and has built a railroad extending three miles back from Lake Tahoe, in order to haul his logs to the water.  After the logs are brought to the water they are enclosed in a triangular boom, and towed across the lake to Glenbrook, where three saw-mills are kept running night and day. About 60,000 feet of lumber are sawed daily at this place.  The lumber having been cut into the required form, is then transported to Carson City, either by wagons or in a flume, whence it is taken to Virginia City. br                                                                                                 Leaving Lake Valley, our party crossed the western summit, taking the Placerville road. The scenery along this route is unsurpassed. In the American Fork cafion the walls rise over 700 feet, and are almost bare of vegetation.  Before the completion of the Pacific railroad this road was the direct highway to the silver mines of Nevada. The travel was so large that  20,000 was received at the toll-houses in a single season. Now this thoroughfare is seldom used save by the Californian fruit venders. It was over this same route that Mr. Greeley took his well-known ride of 109 miles in ten hours with the celebrated driver Hank Monk. Going northward, the highest points in the range were climbed, the principal of which are Pyramid Peak, Tallac Peak, and Twin Peaks. The view from Tallac Peak is one of the finest in America, rivaling even the scene from the summits of the Faulhorn and Righi in Switzerland ; at least twenty lakes are visible, their mirror-like surfaces glistening in the sunlit sky, and forming a pleasant contrast to the somber hues of the densely wooded ridges.   On a clear day Monte Diablo can be seen from Pyramid Peak, 150

        <pagetext>miles distant. The rest of the season was spent in surveying the borders of Lake Tahoe. This lake is remarkable for its great depth, 1,645 feet being the       deepest sounding taken. Lago Maggiore and Lago di Como are the only lakes in Europe deeper than Tahoe. These lakes are respectively 2,800 and 1,980 feet deep, but their elevation is much lower than Tahoe, which lies at the great height of 6,220 feet, or about the same as the top of Mount Washington. A zone of emerald-green water extends along the shore of this lake.  The deep       water has an exquisite ultramarine-blue color, and the transparency of it is wonderful. A white object can be seen at the depth of 115 feet. During storms, waves rise two, three, and even four, feet high. There is always a gently      undulating motion of the water. During a fresh gale the waves beat against       the shore with almost as much noise and force as on the Atlantic coast. The lake is well stocked with fish. Trout may be caught by trolling.  Since the completion of the railroad, only thirteen miles of staging are required to reach       Lake Tahoe.  Hotels have been built on all sides of the lake, and it must sometime become a great pleasure-resort.

The main watersheds in our area include the Lake Tahoe Basin, the Truckee, Carson, and Walker Rivers. Within the Lake Tahoe Basin alone, there are 64 different sub-watersheds. That includes 63 streams that drain into the lake and 1 river - the Truckee that carries water out. It goes without saying that Lake Tahoe’s watershed is unique. There are no factories or other major sources of pollution at Lake Tahoe. So, much of the pollution that is clouding Tahoe’s famous clear blue water is coming from us.

The smallest piece of litter, sediment or other pollutant entering into a stream miles away will eventually in some form make its way to Tahoe. That’s how a watershed works. All those peaks and ridgelines you see around Lake Tahoe act like a big bowl -- everything at the top eventually makes its way to the bottom -- right into the lake.

Tonight we’re turning things around a bit. Shelly Purdy takes a look at current efforts to save the lake.                                                                                                PACKAGE:                                ((Comstock music - PHOTOS))                                                                ((TRACK 1))                                Until recently, possibly the worst time in Lake Tahoe’s history was during the Comstock Lode of the late 1800’s. The Tahoe Basin was virtually clear-cut…and the timber used in the silver mines of Virginia City.                                                                ((SOT tape 2 @ 21:03  Dave Antonucci, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineer))                                “The core sampling showed that there was a distinct period in which a lot of organic matter flowed into the lake. This would be logging slash and debris and sawdust from the mills all flowed into the lake.”                                                                ((TRACK 2))                                But that core sampling also shows that after the Comstock era and before the development boom of the 1960s and 70s the lake actually rebounded…and clarity improved. It’s that data that gives researchers hope for today.                                                                ((SOT tape 2 @ 25:26 Dave Antonucci))                                “There’s hope that if we can reduce or eliminate the flood of human-caused pollutants into lake Tahoe. That it would almost immediately respond by improving clarity.”                                                                ((TRACK 3))                                But time is NOT on our side. Due to Tahoe’s immense size…when a pollutant – in the form of dirt, chemicals or other sediments – gets into the lake it takes a whopping 700 years before it flushes out. That’s why a massive cooperative effort is underway to prevent pollutants from reaching the lake in the first place. Erosion control projects like this roadside drainage system are designed to keep damaging sediments out of the water.                                                                 ((SOT tape 1 @ 18:19 Juan Palma, Executive Director, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))                                “Well over 800 projects are being implemented here at Lake Tahoe. And, we are looking at close to a billion dollars of investment to be able to protect this beautiful alpine lake.”                                                                ((Standup tape 3 @ 14:11 Shelly Purdy))                                “The good news is the experts all agree if we can slow down the rate of pollution the lake should recover over time. But it’s going to take a lot of money and a hurculean effort to do it. Federal, state and local governments along with private businesses and other agencies are working together to tackle this huge restoration effort. I’m Shelly Purdy for News Channel 8.”                                                                ((Anchor Tag/Still Store))                                If you would like more information about what you can do to help reduce the pollution to Lake Tahoe visit our website at kolotv.com. In next week’s Lake Tahoe segment, Shelly will talk about the right and wrong way to remove snow during the wintertime.</description>

But when the snow does fall, we’ve got to put it somewhere. In this week’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy explains why removing snow the right way can make such a big difference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((TAKE PKG))                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((Track 1)) The best way to deal with snow is to plan for it before it falls. Than means setting-up your driveway and yard to be prepared to handle whatever snow does come. Take a good look at your property and develop a snow removal storage plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((SOT Tahoe Tape 5 @ 18:19 John Cobourn, UNR Cooperative Extension))                                                                                                                                &quot;One of the things we really want to do is put the snow...to store it in a place where when it does melt, it’s not gonna carry that dirt directly into a stream or even into a roadside ditch which of course is gonna lead to a stream.&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((Track 2)) Because all that sediment and dirt that gets carried by melting snow into area streams eventually dumps right into Lake Tahoe. That includes storm drains and roadside ditches... whatever goes into them flows untreated directly to the lake.

Somewhere that as it melts the soil underneath can absorb all the dirt and grime the snow leaves behind.

The sun, for instance, can be a pollutant if it causes                                                                                                                                 abnormally high water temperatures.

In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a look at the bad news: non-point source pollution.                                                                                                                                ((Take Pkg))                                                                                                                                ((Track 1))                                                                Non-point source pollution doesn’t come from factories or sewage plants…it comes from thousands of small sources that all add up to one big problem. Those small sources include: dirt and sediment, fertilizer used in landscaping, oil spills from cars and runoff into storm drains. It’s the cumulative effect of those small things that is polluting Lake Tahoe. Educators here use a watershed model to explain to kids how non-point source pollution works.                                                                                                                                ((SOT tape 2 @ :35 Lauri Kemper, Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board))                                                                “The model mimics our natural environment where if you disturb the soil when it rains the soil will be moved into our streams and eventually into Lake Tahoe.”                                                                                                                                ((Track 2))                                                                It’s a simple way to illustrate how little things can do so much damage. The kids put fertilizer on the grass, oil from cars on the road and dirt in areas where the land has been disturbed. Then they spray it all with water bottles to show how rain or snow runoff moves those pollutants into streams and rivers…and eventually into the lake. The model teaches the kids a number of lessons about how to prevent pollution.

That's the purpose of our weekly Lake Tahoe Report. In tonight's segment, Shelly Purdy gives a geologic history lesson about how the lake was formed and explains why that geology makes preserving the amazing clarity of Lake Tahoe so difficult.

A relatively short time ago violent earthquakes pushed the mountains up and caused the bottom to fall out -- leaving the footprint for a future Lake Tahoe.

And the lake was filled with pure glacial melt water. It's this unique geology and extreme depth of Lake Tahoe that helps give it it's amazing crystal blue clarity -- but it's also because of that extreme depth that pollution has such a devastating effect.

    <description>Lake Tahoe Report Segment #13 - &quot;Snapshot Day&quot; (Air Date: April 29 2003). The Tahoe-Truckee Clean Water Team needs volunteers for its annual &quot;Snapshot Day&quot; event. The event is designed to get community volunteers involved in studying the water moving through the Lake Tahoe and Truckee River watersheds. Water samples are taken in order to develop a picture or “snapshot” of water quality and watershed health at a single point in time.</description>

They will do a demonstration of how to collect water samples, take water temps and other measurements. Basically what they’re showing you is what they want volunteers to do on the upcoming &quot;Snapshot Day&quot; where people go out to all the waterways at Tahoe and in the Reno area at the same time and take the same measurements. It gives researchers a &quot;snapshot&quot; of what the watersheds are doing all at the same time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You will interview Melissa Blake about the measurements she’s taking and what the information tells them:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Explain the different measurements - talk through the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 What each measurement means.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Why it’s so important to get people involved to volunteer for the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 It’s fun and easy!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Explain the rewards of volunteering - what you learn from the experience.

    <description>Segment 14 - Air Date: May 6                                                                ((Anchor Intro))                                Researchers at Lake Tahoe are studying everything from what goes into the lake to what                                 is already there. One such researcher from the Desert Research Institute is out on the lake                                 regularly measuring the turbidity of the water. In tonight's Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly                                 Purdy explains what turbidity is all about.                                                                ((TAKE PKG))                                ((Nats - Ken Taylor's boat trolling around))                                                                ((Track 1))                                Researcher Ken Taylor takes his boat out on Lake Tahoe throughout the year. He drives it                                 right next to the shoreline - circling the entire lake. As he drives, the boat pumps water                                 from the front to an instrument inside that measures the turbidity of the water.                                                                ((SOT - tape 2 @ 19:44 Ken Taylor, Desert Research Institute))                                &quot;The water is pumped up through this glass cell and light shines through it and scatters                                 the light and that gives us an indication of how clear the water is.&quot;                                                                ((Track 2))                                If there are a lot of particles like dirt and sediment in the sample?then the water is                                 considered very turbid. In other words - it's difficult to see through the muck that's                                 clouding the water. As Ken Taylor trolls the shoreline of Lake Tahoe, sophisticated                                 computers inside his research boat plot the dirtier areas, shown in red, and the cleaner                                 areas, shown in blue.                                                                ((SOT tape 2 @ 35:29))                                  &quot;It allows us to find out what neighborhoods are causing problems and what                                 neighborhoods aren't causing problems and also allows us by doing surveys at different                                 times of the year, what types of storms are creating problems.&quot;                                                                ((Track 3))                                The information he collects is then used to plan cleanup efforts and other remediation                                 projects in the areas that need it most. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education                                 Coalition, I'm Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                                                                ((Anchor Tag/Still Store))                                If you would like more information about near-shore turbidity or to find out what areas of                                 Lake Tahoe's shoreline have biggest problem with pollution, visit our website at                                 kolotv.com and click on &quot;news.&quot;  In next week's Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly gets up close                                 and personal with algae. It's that slimy green stuff becoming more and more common at                                 Lake Tahoe.</description>

But due to clear-cut logging and development, today only                                                                 40 stands of old growth trees remain at Lake Tahoe. That's a mere 5-percent of the                                                                 majestic big trees that once stood along the lake's shore and surrounding mountains. With                                                                 the lake Tahoe environmental education coalition, I'm Shelly Purdy for kolo news                                                                 channel 8.

    <description>Segment 18 - Urban Stormwater and Infiltration BMP's?                                Air Date: June 3                                                                                                ((Anchor/Intro)) When snow and rain falls, runoff water then fills-up gutters and storm                                 drains. At Lake Tahoe, most of that muddy water flows untreated directly into the lake. In                                 tonight's Lake Tahoe report, Shelly Purdy takes a look at efforts to clean stormwater                                 before it gets the chance to pollute.                                                                ((TAKE PKG))                                                                ((nats urban stormwater tape @ :57-1:15 drainage ditch))                                                                ((Track 1)) This drainage pipe is the end of the line for all the storm drains in the Tahoe                                 City area. The water is collected and sent here - to this man-made wetland built to act as                                 a natural filter. The wetland is a pilot study being conducted by the Tahoe Research                                 Group - an affiliate of the University of California, Davis.                                                                 ((sot urban stormwater tape @ 3:40 ? Andrea Parra, Tahoe Research Group)) 'so, when                                 it rains or snows of any sort of runoff from the streets the drop inlets or drains here                                 collect the water and it all gets routed into one pipe which goes into this cement forebay                                 here. And the cement forebay is meant to slow the water down and let the larger particles                                 settle out.?                                                                ((Track 2)) The water then is able to move slowly through the wetland. The native plants                                 here act as natural filters by picking up the nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment in the                                 water. Essentially the plants ?treat? the water and make it clean. Before development at                                 Lake Tahoe, wetlands like this one surrounded the lake's shore keeping the water clear.                                 But with development most of those wetlands were destroyed?wiping out the lake's                                 natural filtration system. Researchers are now working on ways to rebuild the system.                                                                ((Sot @ 10:38)) &quot;We're trying to recreate the natural system by putting in these man-                                made systems to replace the wetlands we?ve lost.&quot;                                                                ((Track 3)) But finding open land to do these types of projects is proving to be a difficult                                 task. So for now, only a handful of these man-made wetlands are in operation around the                                 lake. With the lake tahoe environmental education coalition, I'm Shelly Purdy for KOLO                                News Channel 8.                                                                ((Ancor/Tag)) By the way, the storm drains here in the Reno area flow directly into the                                 Truckee River untreated. So think about that the next time you wash or change the oil in                                 your car. All those chemicals that flow from your driveway into your gutter do eventually                                 make their way into Lake Tahoe and the Truckee River.

    <description>Segment 20 “Comparing Watersheds: Lake Tahoe vs. Lake Baikal”                                Air Date: June 17                                                                                                ((Anchor/Intro)) Lake Tahoe is widely considered one of the biggest and most magnificent high alpine lakes in the world. But did you know that there is another lake half a world away that dwarfs Lake Tahoe? In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes us to Siberia, Russia.                                                                                                ((TAKE PKG))                                                                ((Track 1)) It’s called Lake Baikal. It is the deepest lake in the world and is so huge that it holds 20 percent of the world’s fresh water. Those are obvious differences between Lake Baikal and Lake Tahoe. But there are also many similarities. Lake Baikal has been described as a snapshot of Lake Tahoe a century ago. The economic development, recreation and tourism that is well established here at Tahoe is just beginning to emerge at Lake Baikal. And it is the goal of the Tahoe-Baikal Institute to help the Russians develop and protect this huge natural resource. The institute runs a student exchange program that allows Russian and American students to interact and learn from each other.                                                                ((sot  baikal tape @  9:05 – Tony Brunello, Executive Director, Tahoe Baikal Institute)) “It’s teaching students who are really on the verge of being tomorrow’s environmental leaders and being able to use lake tahoe and lake baikal as the classroom So we have a really unique opportunity here at Tahoe with the community policy makers and scientists to really show people from around the world what we have developed here and have them take that with them throughout their careers.”                                                                ((Track 2)) Every summer a group of undergrad and graduate students spend 5 weeks at Lake Baikal and 5 weeks at Lake Tahoe. The students not only learn about the science of both lakes, but they also learn about politics, working with government agencies and non-profits and developing sustainable industries like recreation and tourism.                                                                ((sot @ 6:15)) “It’s very interesting for the students to figure out how they can translate quality science into good policy and that’s the main thing that we try and push through the program.”                                                                ((Track 3)) The American students who go through the program get the chance to see what Lake Tahoe might have been like a hundred years ago. And the students from Russia learn the tools they’ll need to create economic growth and protect this amazing natural resource. With the lake tahoe environmental education coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for kolo news channel 8.                                                                ((Anchor/Tag)) Representatives from the Tahoe Rim Trail Associaiton recently visited Siberia and met with a group planning to build the Great Baikal Trail. The folks from Tahoe provided the Russians with expertise on working with government agencies, fundraising, and organizing volunteers. If completed, the Great Baikal Trail would be 15-hundred miles long and circumnavigate Lake Baikal.

    <description>Segment 19 - Recreation Impacts and Trail Use?                                Air Date: June 10                                                                                                ((Anchor/Intro)) The first day of summer is just a couple of weeks away, and that means                                 hiking season is kicking into gear. Those of us living here in the Truckee Meadows are                                 lucky, we have one of the world's premiere hiking trails right in our backyard. In                                 tonight?s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes us for a ride on the Tahoe Rim Trail.                                                                ((TAKE PKG))                                                                 ((nats hiking))                                                                ((Track 1)) The Tahoe Rim Trail is a 165 mile hiking, biking and equestrian trail that                                 follows the ridgetops around Lake Tahoe. The trail took 20 years to build and has now                                 become a world class destination in its own right.                                                                 ((sot tahoe rim trail tape @ :56 - Shannon Raborn, Tahoe Rim Trail Association)) &quot;The                                 economy here at Lake Tahoe is tourism based and recreation is a huge component of that                                 tourism industry here?.(tighten up sot)?and that includes the hiking trails, the mountain                                 bike industry and all the support that the businesses in the area put into that.&quot;                                                                ((Track 2)) And possibly the best part of the Tahoe Rim Trail is that it's free. The trail                                 takes you to some of the most spectacular scenery in the world and you don't have to pay                                 a dime to see it.                                                                ((sot tahoe rim trail tape @ 15:52 - Mark Kimbrough, Tahoe Rim Trail Association))                                 &quot;People want a good experience when they come here and recreation is really high on the                                 list. Gaming's here and there's other things people can do, but recreation is the number                                 one why they come here. You have winter and summer sports and the Tahoe Rim Trail                                 fits in nicely.&quot;                                                                ((Track 3)) But the Tahoe Rim Trail can only stay a premiere recreation destination if it?s                                 taken care of. So, whether you're hiking, mountain biking, riding horses or just                                 sightseeing out on the trail, remember to use good trail etiquette. Pack out what you bring                                 in. Yield to other users, and above all, stay on the trail. Cutting switchbacks causes                                 erosion and destroys the beauty of what you're out here to see.

    <description>Segment 21: &quot;Fertilizer Use&quot; Air Date: May 24                                                                                                ((Anchor Intro)) &quot;If you have a lawn or garden, you know fertilizer can be one of the                                 best tools to use to make your plants grow healthy and green. But if you live around Lake                                 Tahoe or any other water source, you want to be very careful with how much and what                                 kind of fertilizer you use. Shelly Purdy explains in this week's Lake Tahoe Report.&quot;                                                                ((Take Pkg))                                                                 ((Natpop @ 4:24 - pouring water into bottles))                                                                ((Natsot @ 4:34)) &quot;You can see that immediately the granitic soil allows the colored                                 water to flow right through wheras it's much ... the composted soil hangs onto the water                                 longer.&quot;                                                                ((Track 1)) That granitic soil in the bottle on the left is typical of the types of soil found at                                 Lake Tahoe. What's missing in it is the organic material that has been added to the bottle                                 on the right. The granitic soil is extremely porous?and allows water to flow through it                                 much more freely.                                                                ((sot @ 4:54)) &quot;If you fertilize on this granitic soul and put too much water on it it will go                                 right past the roots and down into the water table and eventually into the lake.&quot;                                                                ((Track 2)) That's why the experts recommend that if you do need to use fertilizer on                                 your plants?first add mulch or other organic material to the soil. It will hold the water                                 and make better use of what fertilizer you do apply. Another tip that's especially                                 important here at Lake Tahoe: use fertilizer with little or no phosphorus. That's because                                 the water in Lake Tahoe is extremely rich in nitrogen. When you add phosphorus - like                                 the kind found in fertilizers - it joins with the nitrogen and makes algae grow.                                                                ((Sot 12:43 Michael Donahoe ? Sierra Club)) &quot;So if we can keep the phosphorus out of                                 thel ake we have a good chance of saving the lake and keeping it clear.&quot;                                 ((Track 3)) So pay close attention to the kind of fertilizers you buy. You might even want                                 to try natural fertilizers like &quot;Dr. Earth&quot; that contain live microorganisms in it which help                                 to break down the nutrients so your plants can absorb them better. And only use as much                                 fertilizer as you need. Using too much just adds to the problem.

But new research has shown that when you add soil to the waters of Lake Tahoe,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 that dirt can keep the water brown for as long as seven years. So, what's the best way to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 keep Tahoe blue?

    <description>Segment 23: &quot;BMP's&quot;Air Date: June 8th                                                                ((Anchor intro)) Every homeowner at Lake Tahoe will soon be required to install                                 BMP's on their property. And if you don't know what BMP's are, Shelly Purdy explains                                 in tonight's Lake Tahoe Report.                                                                ((Take Pkg))                                                                ((Track 1)) Jennifer Jesperson may soon be coming to a neighborhood near you?and she                                 might even be coming to your home. There are currently more than 20-thousand homes                                 in the Tahoe basin that need to be evaluated for the BMP retrofit program. And it's                                 Jennifer's job to help homeowners figure out what, if any, BMP's are needed on those                                 properties.                                                                 ((Sot @ 5:20 Jennifer Jesperson, Tahoe Resource Conservation District)) ?In this area,                                 there's some native low ground covers were installed for some revegetation on the bare                                 soil areas and then gravel was installed to capture runoff from the garage and the patio                                 which driped all down through here.?                                                                ((Track 2)) BMP's or best management practices is essentially a fancy name for                                 landscaping designed to control soil erosion.                                                                ((Sot @ 4:45)) &quot;some of the BMP's installed on this property include this rock wall                                 which was extended to retain some of the soil coming off the slope. A drain was installed                                 across the driveway and prefabricated drywall system was installed to capture the                                 runoff.&quot;                                                                ((Track 3)) BMP's range from everything from planting native shrubs and grasses to                                 installing huge retaining walls and terraces. It just depends on what needs to be done at                                 each different location. And though the BMP's you need to install may vary, the end                                 result is always be the same - protecting the clarity of Lake Tahoe by controlling soil                                 erosion.

In tonight's Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy shows us that some plants are better                                                                 suited for the Tahoe area than others.                                                                                                                                ((Take pkg))                                                                                                                                ((Track 1)) If you're going to take the time to plant flowers and trees and shrubs in your                                                                 garden, why bother with something that isn't well adapted to it's environment? When                                                                 you're talking about Lake Tahoe, it's much better to buy plants that are either native or                                                                 have adapted well to the area.                                                                                                                                 ((sot @ 3:27 Dan Yori, High Sierra Nursery)) &quot;You use a native plant first of all because                                                                 it blends in with the environment. Takes a little less care, a lot less water,less fertilizer.&quot;                                                                                                                                ((Track 2)) But the list of native plants like aspens, dogwoods and lupine can be limited if                                                                 you want a wide variety in your garden. Luckily, there are hundreds of other perennials                                                                 that have adapted well to Tahoe's climate.                                                                                                                                 ((sot @ 5:07)) It's been trial and error of plants adapting to the area and as you can see                                                                 the list is wonderful now.                                                                                                                                ((Track 3)) The list includes plants like columbine, phlox, ornamental grasses, and trees                                                                 like golden chain. But if you're planning some planting here at Lake Tahoe be cautious                                                                 about what you buy. Many plants like this yarrow which is very common in the Reno                                                                 area are not well suited for Tahoe.                                                                                                                                ((sot @ 5:20)) &quot;there's several plants that we recommend that people don't plant. A lot                                                                 of the agencies are recommending you don't plant them. Your broom is a very invasive                                                                 plant. Broom is one. The others are some of the yarrows are invasive and you don't want                                                                 to do those.&quot;                                                                                                                                ((Track 4)) So before you plant, check with your local nursery. They can help you choose                                                                 plants that will grow well and look great for years to come.

    <description>Segment 25 - Water Conservation (Air Date July 22)                                                                Anchor Intro: When you look at Lake Tahoe it is so large it's easy to think there is an                                 unlimited supply of water stored within its shores. But the communities that use water                                 from Lake Tahoe have a limit to just how much they can take. In tonight's Lake Tahoe                                 report, Shelly Purdy explains how we can all conserve this valuable resource.                                                                ((Take Pkg))                                                                ((Nats Sprinklers))                                ((Track 1)) Summer is always the time of year when we use water the most. And most of                                  that water is used to irrigate lawns and other outdoor landscaping. You look at almost any                                 home in the Reno/Tahoe area and chances are you'll see a big swath of grass in the front                                 yard. But lawns take a lot of water to keep green.                                                                 ((Sot @ 11:08 Joe Borgadine, Incline Village General Improvement District))                                &quot;A little bit of lawn goes a long way. One of our suggestions is landscape with more                                 drought resistant native plants. I like to have a lawn myself. But what you can do is put                                 the right type of lawn in in the first place.&quot;                                                                ((Track 2)) And when it comes to planting grass here at Lake Tahoe or in the Reno area,                                 consider what type of soil you are planting your lawn on top of. You'll save water in the                                 long run if you prepare your soil by adding mulch or other organic material underneath.                                 And once your lawn is in, water only as much as you need.

    <description>Segment 27 &quot;Tahoe Drinking Water&quot; (Air Date: August 5)                                                                ((Anchor Intro)) If you live at Lake Tahoe or in the Reno/Sparks area chances are your                                 drinking water comes from Lake Tahoe. In tonight?s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy                                 shows us why it's important to keep that in mind when you play at the lake.                                                                ((Track 1)) When you look at all the people who recreate on Lake Tahoe it's easy to think                                 of this lake as a playground instead of a water supply. But consider this?many of the                                 communities that line these shores pump their drinking water directly from the lake. And                                 we in the Reno area get our water from the Truckee River - which flows out of Lake                                 Tahoe.                                                                ((sot @ :42 Michelle Sweeney, Nevada Tahoe Conservation District))                                &quot;And that means that anything you don?t want to have in your drinking water you need to                                 make sure in your daily life doesn?t get into the drinking water.&quot;                                                                ((track 2)) That includes the obvious things like litter and other waste products, oils and                                 gasoline from boats and personal watercraft?and human waste.                                                                ((s/u @ 17:32 Shelly Purdy))                                &quot;Even though Lake Tahoe is obviously much bigger than a swimming pool the same                                 rules apply. You wouldn't swim in water you've gone to the bathroom in so why would                                 you drink it???&quot;                                                                ((sot @ 4:45))                                &quot;Use the restroom before you go towards the lake. Even with little kids even with babies                                 of it's no big deal - but think about what would you want to be coming out of your faucet                                 and consider that in your use of the lake.&quot;                                                                ((Track 3))                                 The water in Lake Tahoe is amazingly clear and clean and very safe and healthy to                                 drink - for now. It will take all of us to keep it that way.

    <description>Segment 28: US Forest Service (Air Date: August 12)                                                                                                                                ((Anchor Intro)) The U.S. Forest Service manages nearly 80-percent of the land in the                                                                 Tahoe Basin. And, that means the agency is a major player in the effort to protect and                                                                 preserve Lake Tahoe. In tonight?s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a closer look at                                                                 role of the forest service.                                                                                                                                ((Take Pkg))                                                                                                                                ((Track 1)) It seems to draw you in when you look at it. The immense blueness of the                                                                 lake is magical - even hypnotic. It's easy to think of the Lake Tahoe area as just the lake.                                                                 But what makes Tahoe so special isn?t just the magical blue water - it's also the forests,                                                                 mountains and wildlife that surround it. And it's the job of the U.S. Forest Service to take                                                                 care of that land. Because the healthier the land around Lake Tahoe - the cleaner and                                                                 clearer the lake.

Those projects include things like forest thinning, road decommissioning,                                                                 erosion control and wetland restoration.

((Take PKG))                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((Track 1)) It really doesn’t look like much. And if you’re not careful, you can step right on it and not even notice. The Tahoe Yellow Cress is a small, low growing plant with pretty little flowers. It is found only on the sandy beaches of Lake Tahoe…and nowhere else in the world. And that can be a problem especially in periods of high water when beach space is at a premium. The plants are easily trampled by people walking and enjoying the beach. Here at Sand Harbor, this small colony of plants has been protected with fencing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((sot @ 9:37 Mike Volmer, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency)) “Where we have natural populations we try to fence them off and give them a little signage so people can learn about the plant and how to identify it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((Track 2)) There is also an effort underway at Tahoe to grow the seeds in a greenhouse and revegetate the beaches with Yellow Cress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ((sot @ 11:21)) “Extinction is forever, so we feel some obligation to at least provide a place for it to perpetuate.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((Track 3)) Because who knows?? The Tahoe Yellow Cress might be more than just a pretty little flowering plant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((Sot @ 10:50)) “Why Should We care? Part of it is that there’s a genetic legacy that we’re not aware of. We don’t know what role it plays necessarily in the ecology here. We don’t know what else is connected.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((Track 4)) With the lake tahoe environmental education coalition, I’m shelly purdy nc8.

For many years, the public beach there has been a little-used and quite frankly neglected piece of lakefront property.  But that will soon change when the newly restored Commons Beach opens to the public this week. Shelly Purdy has more in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                                                                ((Track 1)) Workers are busy putting the finishing touches on the new “Jewel of Tahoe City” …Commons Beach. The transformation of this public park has been truly remarkable. And it’s all been done with the health of Lake Tahoe in mind. The once badly eroding hillside above the park has been stabilized with decorative rock retaining walls, new walkways with ADA access have been built, and ground stabilizing trees and shrubs have been planted.                                                                ((sot @ 13:40, Robert Lourey, Tahoe City Public Utility District))                                “There’s also a little over 6,000 plantings and plants that have been placed on the slope areas that as they thrive they will also protect the erosion from the steep slope down to the lake.”                                                                ((Track 2)) …and that’s not all.                                                                ((S/U @ 15:48, Shelly Purdy))                                “This little area right here may not look like much, but actually underneath this grate and these three manholes is a state of the art water filtration system that’s going to take out sand, sediment even oils from stormwater before it enters into the lake.”                                                                ((Track 3)) But these water quality improvements are not what visitors to Commons Beach will appreciate the most. There is a new lakeside bike path, a fabulous kids playground complete with a climbing wall and finger park where kids can play with their match-box cars and GI joes, a new sand beach, picnic area, and of course breathtaking views of Lake Tahoe.                                                                ((sot @ 11:30))                                “It now looks like a public beach that they can see when they come to town. And this is I think going to be the jewel of Tahoe City.”                                                                ((Track 4)) With the lake tahoe education coalition, I’m shelly purdy for kolo nc8.                                                                Anchor Tag: The grand opening party for Commons Beach will be held this Friday, October 31st. An interesting fact about Commons Beach - the land where the park is located was donated to the people of Tahoe City by Ulysses S. Grant in 1872.</description>

    <description>Lake Tahoe Report Segment #38 - &quot;Prescribed Fire: Managing Smoke and Fire in the Tahoe Basin&quot; (Air Date: October 21, 2003). Officials at Bliss State Park discuss using prescribed burning which reintroduces small, low-burning fires in order to avoid the out-of-control, crown-type fires that happen in a wildfire.</description>

Fall is                                                                 not only the season for turning leaves and colder temperatures, but also the season for                                                                 prescribed burning. Shelly Purdy explains in tonight's Lake Tahoe Report.

State part officials are planning a prescribed                                                                 burn this fall, and they're now waiting for the ideal conditions before they ignite any                                                                 flames. Two years of work has already gone into to the forest here - in preparation for                                                                 burning. The trees have been thinned and pruned, the debris has been chipped in some                                                                 areas, and the remaining slash has been piled. Those piles will then be burned all in the                                                                 effort to reduce the amount of fuel in the forest.

No trees, bare soil                                                                 and burnt and ugly.&quot;                                                                                                                                ((Track 2)) What many people don't realize is fire played a huge role in the evolution of                                                                 the forests around Lake Tahoe. It's only been the past century or so that man has altered                                                                 that history of fire by putting out anything that flares-up. The result is a forest around                                                                 Lake Tahoe that has too many trees, and tons and tons of forest litter.                                                                                                                                ((sot @ 9:07))                                                                 &quot;A lot of these downed trees, limbs, branches, needles, etc. that keep accumulating every                                                                 year as the trees shed all this extra debris. What we haven't seen due to fire suppression is                                                                 any mechanism to get rid of this forest litter, so what we're trying to do is mimic this fire                                                                 regime.&quot;                                                                                                                                ((track 3)) But doing that in a safe way can be tricky. That?s why pre-treating by thinning                                                                 trees and removing extra debris is so important. You can just imagine what starting a                                                                 prescribed burn in an area like this would do - the trees here are so thick and there is so                                                                 much extra wood to burn?the results would be disastrous. In contrast, prescribed                                                                 burning in an area like this that's been pre-treated can be easily controlled and safely                                                                 done.

More than a century of fire suppression has left our forests thick with fuel and ready to burn. In tonight's Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy shows the efforts underway to prevent a major fire from happening at Lake Tahoe.

Luckily, none of these fires has developed into a major catastrophe.  To help prevent this from happening, fire protection agencies including the Forest Service are working on hazardous fuels reduction projects near Tahoe communities.  They remove heavy accumulations of dead materials, thin overstocked areas and use pile burns to eliminate the debris.  Ideally, the goal is to return  fire to its historic role in forest health.

    <description>Segment 33 – Tahoe Forest Stewardship Day (Air Date: September 16)                                                                                                                                Anchor Intro: Last summer's Gondola Fire charred nearly 700 acres of forest in South Lake Tahoe. This weekend you have a chance to help rehabilitate the land burned in the fire and learn something about the environment. Shelly Purdy has details in tonight's Lake Tahoe Report.                                                                                                                                ((Take Pkg))                                                                                                                                ((Nats fire...))                                                                                                                                ((Track 1)) It was a fast burning and very hot fire that raced up the mountainsid. Luckily no homes were destroyed…but unluckily nearly 700 acres of timber were charred.                                                                                                                                 ((Nats shoveline @ :36))                                                                                                                                ((Track 2)) And that's where you come in. No matter your age or ability level...you are invited to participate in this year's annual Stewardship Day sponsored by the League to Save Lake Tahoe. You'll get a chance to learn about the forest and do some work rehabilitating land that burned in the fire.                                                                                                                                ((sot @ 6:08, Dan Sussman, League to Save Lake Tahoe))                                                                &quot;The purpose of the event is twofold. One, we invite people to come out so hopefully they'll have some connection to the area they live in. they'll have a chance to learn about the forest that surrounds them and as well as doing some good work.&quot;                                                                                                                                ((Track 3)) This will be the second year of work at the Gondola Fire site. Last year, workers placed logs in areas prone to erosion. The logs help keep soil in place so new vegetation can begin to grow.                                                                                                                                ((Standup @ 14:08, Shelly Purdy))                                                                &quot;This little Jeffrey Pine was planted during last year's Stewardship Day and as you can see the forest is starting to re-grow and wildlife is even returning to the area.&quot;                                                                                                                                ((Nats – woodpecker))                                                                                                                                ((Track 4)) The woodpeckers are here…and so are the red tailed hawks. Stewardship day will give you the chance to see it all and learn about fire's devastating effects.                                                                                                                                ((sot @ 7:37))                                                                 &quot;The Gondola fire really did give people a knock on the door and said look this can happen in your back yard, this can happen to you. Why don't you come out and see what you can do to restore the area. Why not come out and learn how not only how it effects you but how you can effect the land...&quot;                                                                ((Track 5)) With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I'm Shelly Purdy for kolo news channel 8.

    <description>Segment 34 &quot;Stream &amp; Wetland Restoration&quot; (Air Date: September 23)                                                                ((Anchor Intro)) Restoring wetlands and streams has turned into a top priority at Lake                                 Tahoe since wetlands act as a natural filter for sediment and runoff. In tonight?s Lake                                 Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes as look at a major restoration project in South Lake                                 Tahoe.                                                                ((Take Pkg))                                                                ((Track 1)) In 1960 this magnificent wetland was destroyed. A developer came here and                                  channelized the creek and dammed the end of the meadow to create a man-made lake. A                                 lake that eventually turned into an unhealthy murky mess. It made the site a prime                                 candidate for restoration, and in 1994 Cold Creek and the meadow were reconstructed.                                 The creek was rebuilt so that it could meander naturally through the meadow. The banks                                 were stabilized, and native vegetation was planted.                                                                 ((Sot @ 14:12 Steve Goldman, California Tahoe Conservancy))                                &quot;We used a combination of all natural materials. We didn't use concrete and pipe and                                 other man made materials that are typically used in stream projects.&quot;                                                                ((Track 2)) At the time, it was a bit of an experiment to see if a site this damaged and this                                 large could be rehabilitated. Obviously, the experiment worked. Wildlife has come back                                 to the meadow. Fish have come back to the creek. And the wetland is working as it                                 should - filtering sediment into the meadow instead of sending dirt and rocks                                 downstream into Lake Tahoe.                                                                ((Sot @ 18:39)) &quot;Just the lushness of the system shows that it's working. The water and                                 the nutrients are helping to grow the meadow vegetation. They're not helping to grow                                 algae in the lake.&quot;                                                                ((Track 3)) And that's what wetland restoration projects are all about - helping to keep                                 Lake Tahoe blue.

These 5th graders at Incline Elementary                                                                                                                                 School are learning about the balance of nature. And in the process, they?re also learning                                                                                                                                 math, science and language skills.

Many of those projects are housed at the University of California, Davis’ research facility near Tahoe City. But as Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report…that facility has some serious problems.                                                                                                                                ((Take Pkg))                                                                                                                                ((Track 1)) The building was built in 1920 as a fish hatchery. And from the looks of it, most of the structure is still original. The beautiful scissor beams are still holding the building up…but there is major roof damage, a broken sewer line, old and unreliable electrical wiring and unbelievably cramped working conditions. The joke around here is that they are doing world class research in a third world facility.                                                                                                                                ((sot @ 1:39 Dr. Charles Goldman, University of California, Davis))                                                                “Even the Russians are embarrassed when they come look at what we operate out of. So, the plan now is to build a new building and convert this into a world class science center.”                                                                                                                                ((track 2)) Private donors have already contributed 13.2 million dollars. Part of the money will be used to restore this building and turn it into a science center for kids. The rest will fund the construction of a new state-of-the-art research laboratory. Looking around the building here, there is no question a new facility is needed. The researchers are doing everything from monitoring algae growth, to testing sediment samples, to helping NASA with various experiments…all in a few small rooms using hand-me-down furniture and equipment. The work they’re doing is key to the overall effort to save Lake Tahoe. The researchers here argue they can do a whole lot more if they have the right tools to work with.                                                                                                                                ((Sot @ 2:02)) “We desperately need a world class research center so that not only can we attract a variety of other scientists to work at Lake Tahoe but also Nevada groups particularly the Desert Research Institute and University of Nevada.”                                                                                                                                ((Track 3)) With the lake tahoe environmental education coalition, I’m shelly purdy kolo nc8.

        <pagetext>On February 14, 1844, an exploration party headed by Captain John Charles Fremont and guided by Christopher  Kit  Carson, struggled through the heavy snows in upper Hope Valley toward a pass that the Paiute Indians had indicated would lead them over the Sierra Nevada into the Valley of the Sacramento. Fremont, representing the United States Topographical Engineers, had been searching for the mythical Buenaventura River and Mary's Lake. Now he, Carson and the remnants of their original group of 39 men were caught in the Great Snowy Range in mid-winter. Two weeks had been spent in breaking trail through the mounting snowdrifts. Their Indian guides and bearers had deserted. Provisions were running low and in order to survive they must scale the formidable barrier rising ahead. br  br       The party followed the course of the East Fork of the Carson River up the mountains to a site near the present town of Markleeville, where it encountered deep snow. Fremont's group pushed west, braving severe winter conditions and rapidly diminishing provisions, including the complete exhaustion of the party's rock salt supply, a major loss. Any ambulatory fur-covered creature they came upon was liable to become a course for supper. In his report Fremont noted one evening's meal.  We had tonight an extraordinary dinner -- pea soup, mule, and dog.  br  br       As the men neared the first summit divide, Fremont and his topographer, Charles Preuss, struck northwest toward  the highest peak to the right of the pass  to take observations. This peak, at 10,063 feet in elevation, would later be named Red Lake Peak, after Red Lake, a small marshy lake at its foot. It is located about two miles north of where Carson Pass is today. Upon gaining the top they looked north across what would become known, a decade later, as Luther Pass and Lake Valley. In the distance, some 16 miles away, they were astonished to see a magnificent expanse of blue water. In his report of the expedition, published in 1845, Fremont wrote,  We had a beautiful view of a mountain lake at our feet, about 15 miles in length, and so entirely surround by mountains that we could not discover an outlet.  Fremont's estimation of the lake's length was short by about seven miles, and the  outlet  he searched for would turn out to be the Truckee River he had found in the north and named  Salmon Trout.  br  br       The Indians had called the lake  Tahoe,  for  big water.  Fremont christened it  Lake Bonpland.  Bonpland was a French botanist who had accompanied the German explorer Alexander von Humboldt to South America and also to New Spain on his cartographic missions. Humboldt, who was believed to have explored portions of Alta California, had

        <pagetext>been one of Fremont's idols; and he renamed Mary's River in the Utah Territory after him. When Preuss drew his map of the region, however, the cartographer called the it  Mountain Lake.  Apparently, the lake failed to impress Preuss as it did Fremont, for the former failed to mention it in his diary. California legislators named it Lake Bigler after the state's second governor. Bigler was a notorious secessionist during the Civil War, however, and most people began referring to the lake by his original Indian name, which the Legislature -- with typical dispatch -- confirmed by statute in 1945. br  br       On February 20, Fremont and Carson led the expedition farther west through the Sierra Nevada and crested the range over a summit (8,600 feet) now known as Carson Pass, though the route they followed was slightly south of its present-day location. The next day, Fremont and his party viewed the lake for the second time. In his Report, he observed:  Immediately above the eastern mountains was repeated a cloud-formed mass of purple ranges, bordered with bright yellow gold; the peaks shot up into a narrow line of crimson cloud, above which the air was filled with a greenish orange; and over all was the singular beauty of the blue sky. Passing along a ridge which commanded the lake on our right - we began to discover an outlet through a chasm on the west.  br  br       Fremont was now between Twin Lakes and Little Round Top due south of Tahoe, and the  chasm on the west  that he judged to be the stream leading out of the lake was actually the canyon of the South Fork of the American River, which heads at Audrain Lake, less than a mile, airline distance, from the Upper Truckee River. From a high peak they could see spread out before them the verdant Sacramento Valley, and farther in the distance they could see Mt. Diablo, which Carson recognized, having been there during his first trip to California years before with the Ewing Young expedition. Having crested the Sierra Nevada, Fremont's party began its descent, which turned out to be exceptionally difficult because of the terrain and the severe winter climate. br  br       Although the explorer erred in identifying the lake's outlet, not realizing that it was actually on the west side of Tahoe and the headwaters of the Salmon Trout River (Truckee) which he had located and named several weeks before, he did establish a number of  firsts.  The initial winter crossing of the Central Sierra Nevada mountains by white men had been made, the first peak in the Sierra surmounted, Lake Tahoe discovered and the Kit Carson Pass route, over which a floodtide of '49'ers would move, had been run out.

        <pagetext>From the Carson Pass the expedition turned northwest and traveled on a track that led between Twin Lakes (Caples Lake) and Silver Lake, and then down the mountain slopes to the South Fork of the American River, which they struck at a site near Strawberry Lodge. At Strawberry they found forage for their animals, which they decided to  recruit,  or to feed and rest to recover their strength and stamina. br  br       John Charles Fremont was an officer in the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers. He had a colorful if not distinguished career in the army. He became known as the Great Pathfinder for his explorations of the Pacific far west and California. The report of his second expedition,   (Report of the Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains in the Year 1842, and to Oregon and North California in the Years 1843-'44. Washington: Gales and Seaton, Printers. 1845) which carried him across the Sierra Nevada, sold like a bestseller, having been co-written by his wife Jessie, daughter of the politically powerful Sen. Thomas Hart  Old Bullion  Benton, a fervent expansionist and booster of America's  Manifest Destiny.  Fremont was also the covert leader and probably the fomenter of the Bear Flag Rebellion and served for a month as the state's military governor. He became the owner of a tract of land - - literally by mistake -- in Mariposa County on which enormously rich gold placers were located. He topped his stunning career by running for president as the first candidate of the Republican Party. br  br       Hughey, Richard.  Capt.

        <pagetext>February 11. - High wind continued, and our trail this morning was nearly invisible -- here and there indicated by a little ridge of snow. Our situation became tiresome and dreary, requiring a strong exercise of patience and resolution. br  br       In the evening I received a message from Mr. Fitzpatrick, acquainting me with the utter failure of his attempt to get our mules and horses over the snow -- the half-hidden trail had proved entirely too slight to support them, and they had broken through, and were plunging about or lying half buried in snow. He was occupied in endeavoring to get them back to his camp; and in the mean time sent to me for further instructions. I wrote to him to send the animals immediately back to their old pastures; and, after having made mauls and shovels, turn in all the strength of his party to open and beat a road through the snow, strengthening it with branches and boughs of the pines. br  br       February 12. - We made mauls, and worked hard at our end of the road all the day. The wind was high, but the sun bright, and the snow thawing. We worked down the face of the hill, to meet the people at the other end -- Towards sundown it began to grow cold, and we shouldered our mauls, and trudged back to camp. br  br       February 13. - We continued to labor on the road ; and in the course of the day had the satisfaction to see the people working down the face of the opposite hill, about three miles distant. During the morning we had . the pleasure of a visit from Mr. Fitzpatrick, with the information that all was going on well. A party of Indians had passed on show shoes, who said they were going to the western side of the mountain after fish. This was an indication that the salmon were coining up the streams; and we could hardly restrain our impatience as we thought of them, and worked with increased vigor. br  br       The meat train did not arrive this evening, and I gave Godey leave to kill our little dog, (Tlamath,) which he prepared in Indian fashion ; scorching off the hair, and washing the skin with soap and snow, and then cutting it up into pieces, which were laid on the snow. Shortly afterwards, the sleigh arrived with a supply of horse meat; and we had to-night an extraordinary dinner -- pea soup, mule, and dog. br  br       February 14. - Annexed is a view of the dividing ridge of the Sierra, taken from this encampment. With Mr. Preuss, I ascended to-day the highest peak to the right; from which we had a beautiful view of a mountain lake at our feet, about fifteen miles in length, and so entirely surrounded by mountains that we could not discover an outlet.' We had taken with us a glass; but, though we enjoyed an extended view, the valley was half bidden in mist, as when we had seen it before. Snow could be distinguished on the higher parts of the coast mountains; eastward, as far as the eye could extend, it ranged over a terrible mass of broken snowy mountains, fading off blue in the distance. The rock composing the summit consists of a very coarse dark volcanic conglomerate; the lower parts appeared to be of a slaty structure. The highest trees were a few scattering cedars and aspens. From the immediate foot of the peak, we were two hours in reaching the summit, and one hour and a quarter in descending. The day had been very bright, still, and clear, and spring seems to be advancing rapidly. While the sun is in the sky, the snow melts rapidly, and gushing springs cover the face of the mountain in all the exposed places ; but their surface freezes instantly with the disappearance of the sun.

        <pagetext>February 21.-We now considered ourselves victorious over the mountain ; having only the descent before us. and the valley under our eyes, we felt strung hope that we should force our way down. But this was a case in which the descent was NOT facile. Still deep fields of snow lay between, and there was a large intervening space of rough-looking mountains, through which we had yet to wind our way. Carson roused me this morning with an early fire, and we were all up long before day, in order to pass the snow fields before the sun should render the crust soft. We enjoyed this morning a scene, at sunrise, which even here was unusually glorious and beautiful. Immediately above the eastern mountains was repeated a cloud-formed mass of purple ranges, bordered with bright yellow gold ; the peaks shot up into a narrow line of crimson cloud, above which the air was filled with a greenish orange ; and over all was the singular beauty of the blue sky. Passing along a ridge which commanded the lake on our right, of which we began to discover an outlet through a chasm on the west, we passed over alternating open ground and hard-crusted snow fields which supported the animals, and encamped on the ridge after a journey of 6 miles.  The grass was better than we had yet seen, and we were encamped in a clump of trees twenty or thirty feet high, resembling white pine. With the exception of these small clumps, the ridges were bare; and, where the snow found the support of the trees, the wind had blown it up into banks ten or fifteen feet high. It required much care to hunt out a practicable way, as the most open places frequently led to impassable banks. br  br       We had hard and  doubtful labor yet before us, as the snow appeared to be heavier where the timber began further down, with few open spots.  Ascending a height, we traced out the best line we could discover for the next day's march, and had at least the consolation to see that the mountain descended rapidly. The day had been one of April; gusty, with a few occasional flakes of snow; which, in the afternoon, enveloped the upper mountain in clouds. We watched them anxiously, as now we dreaded a snow storm. Shortly afterwards we heard the roll of thunder, and, looking towards the valley, found it all enveloped in a thunder storm. For us, as connected with the idea of summer, it had a singular charm; and we watched its progress with excited feelings until nearly sunset, when the sky cleared off brightly, and we saw a shining line of water directing its course towards another, a broader and larger sheet. We knew that these could be no other than the Sacramento and the bay of San Francisco ; but, after our long wandering in rugged mountains, where so frequently we had met with disappointments, and where the crossing of every ridge displayed some unknown lake or river, we were yet almost afraid to believe that we were at last to escape into the genial country of which we had heard so many glowing descriptions, and dreaded again to find some vast interior lake, whose bitter waters would bring us disappointment. On the southern shore of what appeared to be the bay could be traced the gleaming line where entered another large stream ; and again the Buenaventura rose up in our minds. br  br       Carson had entered the valley along the southern side of the bay, and remembered perfectly to have crossed the mouth of a very large stream, which they had been obliged to raft ; but the country then was so entirely covered with, water from snow and rain, that he had been able to form no correct impression of watercourses. br  br       We had the satisfaction to know that at least there were people below.

        <pagetext>Fires were lit up in the valley just at night, appearing to be in answer to ours; and these signs of life renewed, in some measure, the gayety of the camp. They appeared so near, that we judged them to be among the timber of some of the neighboring ridges ; but, having them constantly in view day after day, and night after night, we afterwards found them to be fires that had been kindled by the Indians among the tulares on the shore of the bay, 80 miles distant. br  br       Among the very few plants that appeared here, was the common blue flax. To-night, a mule was killed for food. br  br       February 22.-Our breakfast was over long before day. We took advantage of the coolness of the early morning to get over the snow, which to-day occurred in very deep banks among the timber; but we searched out the coldest places, and the animals passed successfully with their loads the hard crust. Now and then, the delay of making a road occasioned much labor and loss of time. In the after part of the day, we saw before us a handsome grassy ridge point; and, making a desperate push over a snow field 10 to 15 feet deep, we happily succeeded in getting the camp across; and encamped on the ridge, after a march of three miles. We had again the prospect of a thunder storm below; and to-night we killed another mule -- now our only resource from starvation. br  br       We satisfied ourselves during the day that the lake had an outlet between two ranges on the right; and with this, the creek on which I had encamped probably effected a junction below. Between these, we were descending. br  br       We continued to enjoy the same delightful weather; the sky of the same beautiful blue, and such a sunset and sunrise as on our Atlantic coast we could scarcely imagine. And here among the mountains, 9,000 feet above the sea, we have the deep-blue sky and sunny climate of Smyrna and Palermo, which a little map before me shows are in the same latitude. br  br       The elevation above the sea, by the boiling point, is 8,565 feet. br  br       February 23.-This was our most difficult day : we were forced on the ridges by the quantity of snow among the timber, and obliged to take to the mountain sides, where, occasionally, rocks and a southern exposure afforded us a chance to scramble along. But these were steep, and slippery with snow and ice; and the tough evergreens of the mountain impeded our way, tote our skins, and exhausted our patience. Some of us had the misfortune to wear moccasins with parfleche soles, so slippery that we could not keep our feet, and generally crawled across the snow beds. Axes and mauls were necessary to-day, to make a road through the snow. Going ahead with Carson to reconnoitre the road, we reached in the afternoon the river which made the outlet of the lake. Carson sprang over, clear across a place where the stream was compressed among rocks, but the parfleche sole of my moccasin glanced from the icy rock, and precipitated me into the river. It was some few seconds before I could recover myself in the current, and Carson, thinking me hurt, jumped in after me, and we both had an icy bath. We tried to search a while for my gun, which had been lost in the fall, but the cold drove us out; and making a large fire on the bank, after we had partially dried ourselves we went back to meet the camp. We afterwards found that the gun had been slung under the ice which lined the banks of the creek. br  br       Using our old plan of breaking the road with alternate horses, we reached the creek in the evening; and encamped on a dry open place in the ravine.

        <pagetext>Dearborn, William L. A Map Illustrative of the route of the Proposed Railroad from St. Louis to the Bay of San Francisco, Compiled from the Maps and reports of Coln. Fremont. Tappan   Bradford's Lith., Boston.   ca. 1850. br  br       This map was printed approximately five years after the 1845 Report. The detail shown here shows Lake Tahoe, named as L. Bonplund. Fremont had named it Lake Bonpland after a French botanist who had accompanied the German explorer Alexander von Humboldt to South America and also to New Spain on his cartographic missions. Humboldt, who was believed to have explored portions of Alta California, had been one of Fremont's idols; and he renamed Mary's River in the Utah Territory after him.

In it are the machine shops, round-house, and freight depot of the Central Pacific, and many good and substantial buildings, both public and private. Before the Carson and Colorado Railroad was built, Wadsworth was a shipping-point for many mining towns and camps to the southward.  It still has a very fair trade. br  br       VERDI, eleven miles west of Reno, on the Central Pacific, is a pleasant little lumbering town on the Truckee River, at the eastern base of the Sierras.

Taking into consideration the surroundings, there   is nowhere in the world a more grandly beautiful mountain lake.  The lake lies between the eastern and western summit ridges of the main ridge of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, at an elevation of 6,247 feet above the level of the sea.  Its length is a little over twenty-one miles, and its width about twelve miles. Roughly it has the form of a parallelogram, lying nearly north and south, about one-third in Nevada

        <pagetext>and the remainder in California. It has an area of 204 square miles, as is shown by measurements made in four places across its width, and longitudinally (north and south) in three places.  Its greatest depth is 1,8oo feet. br  br       It is shut in and surrounded on all sides by mountains that rise to a height of from 2,000 to 5,000 feet above its surface.  The lake evidently occupies an extinct volcanic crater of great size.  Soundings show in the bottom a deep channel or crevice which extends neatly the whole length of the lake in a north and south direction.  In this the depth is everywhere from 1,500 to 1,700 feet. The deepest spot (1,800 feet) is toward the south end of the lake, in front of Mount Tallac. The water is of great purity and crystal clearness, and never freezes. br  br       The lake receives the waters of fifty-one creeks and brooks, the largest of which is the Upper Truckee, which falls in at the south end.  It also receives the aqueous contributions of almost innumerable ravines, gorges, and canyons.  It drains an area of over 500 square miles, composed largely of lofty mountains on which the snow falls to a depth of many feet, and by the melting of which the numerous streams are fed.  There are also many living springs on the sides of the surrounding mountain, with a great number (both hot and cold) along the shores of the lake, and doubtless a much larger number deep beneath its surface.  The only outlet of the lake is the Truckee

        <pagetext>River, at its northwest corner.  This outlet, which forms the head of the Truckee River, is fifty feet in width, has an average depth of five feet, and a velocity of six feet a second, making the discharge 123,120,000 cubic feet in twenty-four hours, in early spring when the snow in the mountains is rapidly melting. br  br       Since it was first seen by white men the lake has been given several different names. Tahoe is popularly supposed to be a Washoe Indian word, that means  big water.   Some say the word means  deep water,   clear water,   elevated water,  or  bright water.   The Washoe Indians themselves say they know nothing about the word.  Fremont saw it in 1844, and simply called it  Mountain Lake.   It was once mapped as  Lake Bonpland,  and in 1859 was mapped by Dr. Henry De Groot as  Lake De Groot.   It was also once known as  Lake Bigler,  being so named by some in honor of a Democratic Governor of California, and the name is still used by some of the strait-laced among the Democracy.  Tahoe, whatever it may mean, is a name now so universally acknowledged and so firmly fixed that it is not likely that it will ever be supplanted by any other. br  br       Lake Tahoe is surrounded on all sides by mountains that have an elevation of from 3,000 to 5,000 feet above its surface.  Mount Tallac towers to a height of 11,000 feet above the level of the sea; Pyramid  Peak, 10,000; Monument  Peak, 10,000;

        <pagetext>Rubicon Peaks, fifteen miles west of the lake, 9,284; Job's Peak, 10,637; Sand Mountain, back of Rowland's, 8,747 feet; and Bald Mountain, Mount Pluto, Mount Anderson, Old Hat, Mount Ellis, Barker's Peak, Table Mountain, the Cliffs, the Needles, and many other peaks, rise to a height of over 8,000 feet.  On all sides great old peaks stand about gazing down forever upon their reflected images in the lake below.  It is a grand convocation of mountains, a convention of granite peaks, gray and ancient.  In a circle about the lake stand pine-clad mountains, snow-clad mountains, and unclad mountains that are merely stupendous piles of granite -- granite cathedrals piled up by nature for the delectation of those of her votaries that ever gladly worship at her shrine. br  br       In places towering rocks stand quite near the water, and around the shores are so many bays and inlets, so many jutting points and tongues of land, that there is a constant change of views -- an endless succession of either grand or picturesque effects.  A single cliff --as Shakespeare Rock -- seen from different points and distances, takes a dozen different shapes, and so of all prominent capes and caves.  The distance round the shores of the lake is 144 miles, and may be said to represent that many miles of landscape panorama of unrivaled beauty and grandeur.  Volumes have already been written descriptive of the wonders and the beauties of Lake Tahoe, and innumerable volumes will still be written as the ages pass,

        <pagetext>yet to comprehend the place it must be seen and felt. br  br    It speaks well for Lake Tahoe that its beauties are appreciated and prized by persons living near by in California and Nevada, and that it is a favorite place of summer resort with the people everywhere on the Pacific Coast.  In the Bible it is said:  A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country and in his own house,  and the same may generally be said of celebrated natural objects, but it is different in the case of Tahoe -- the grand and picturesque scenery of the lake is admired and esteemed at home.  It is not only looked upon as being a great sanitarium of the Pacific Coast, but also as a grand store-house of all the delights of mountain scenery.  In Tahoe the careworn and debilitated find a cure for both mind and body. br  br       The water of the lake is as cold and pure as that of the best living springs, and it possesses wonderful charms -- almost the transparency of the atmosphere.  Near the shore, when shallow, it is of an emerald green here; in deep water, in the sunshine, it is of an ultramarine tinge, and in the shade an indigo blue.  Tossing, distant, deep water in certain lights assumes tints of purple and violet, with beautiful flashes of ruby.  Seated in a boat on the lake in a calm, one may see the stones and pebbles at the bottom, with trout cruising about, where the sounding line shows seventy-five feet of water. The whole dome of the sky, with every fleecy cloud, is there perfectly reflected.

        <pagetext>We are midway between the heavens above and the heavens below, gently rocking upon the waving veil of blue that separates the two firmaments. br  br       It is difficult to swim in the lake.  Some have supposed this to be on account of the great elevation and reduced atmospheric pressure on the water, rendering the lake less buoyant than bodies of fresh water at sea level.  This, however, is a mistake.  Water is only very slightly compressible.  The great purity of the water of course renders it less dense than that of lakes holding minerals in solution, but it is the coldness of the water and the variety of the atmosphere that render swimming difficult and laborious. br  br       The bodies of persons drowned in the lake (unless very near shore) are never again seen.  The bodies of no fewer than ten or twelve white men are known to lie at the bottom of the lake; and no doubt among them lie the skeletons of not a few Indians.  The lake is in some respects treacherous and dangerous.  It is subject to sudden and heavy squalls.  Fierce gusts of wind at times rush down the big canyons, and, striking the water, cause it to boil like a pot.  These squalls are liable to capsize a sail-boat.  Unless an experienced boatman be of the party, it is best to have the sail in hand, that it may be let go in a moment.  The squalls generally plunge down the canyons and gorges on the west side of the lake. br  br       The route of the passenger steamers round the lake is near the shores.  These are in some places rocky

        <pagetext>and in others level.  In the mountain gorges and on the ridges are pines and various other evergreen trees, but down near the edge of the water are small groves of quaking asp, willow, and other trees of deciduous foliage. br  br       At the Hot Springs is a good hotel, bathing houses, and other accommodations.  At Tahoe City will also be found good hotels, boats, fishing tackle, and all such little sporting supplies as the visitor is likely to require.  McKinney's at Sugar Pine Point, on the west side of the lake, is a popular place of resort and possesses many attractions.  At Glenbrook, on the east side of the lake, are good hotel accommodations, and there may also be had boats, fishing tackle, and all ordinary supplies.  In many charming nooks and valleys around the shores are hotels and cottages for the accommodation of visitors. br  br       EMERALD BAY -- One of the most beautiful spots about Lake Tahoe is Emerald Bay.  It is the gem of the place.  The bay is situated at the south end of the lake.  It is 2 1/2 miles long and 1 1/4 wide, nearly as large as Donner Lake.  The entrance to it is through a channel less than 200 yards in width, but containing a depth of water sufficient to float a man-of-war.  Emerald Bay is surrounded by grand and picturesque mountains, the peaks of which are 9,000 feet above the level of the sea, and some of which rise precipitously to a height of 4,000 feet above the surface of the bay.  The water is nearly always of a beautiful

        <pagetext>emerald green.  In the bay is a rocky and romantic little island of about three acres, on which is a handsome little cottage.  On the island is a tomb excavated in the rock by an old boatman known as  Captain Dick.   Captain Dick fondly hoped that this tomb would be his last resting-place, but his body lies at the bottom of the lake.  In October, 1873, his boat was capsized in a furious squall, and Captain Dick was never seen again. br  br       Emerald Bay, with 519 acres of surrounding land, belongs to the estate of the late Dr. P, T, Kirby, of Virginia City, who at the time of his death was about to build a fine and commodious hotel.  Before his death, however, he had built over a dozen neat cottages.  Heretofore, owing to lack of accommodations there, many tourists have failed to visit this bay, the most beautiful nook about the lake, but it will now at once become a favorite haunt of all lovers of the grand, picturesque, and beautiful.  The island is a little gem, and has about it a style that gives it almost the appearance of being a toy constructed by a landscape gardener.  It has been very appropriately named  Coquette Island.   It rises to a height of about 200 feet above the surface of the bay.  At the south end of the bay are the  Lovers' Falls,   These falls are high up on the side of a steep and rocky mountain.  They are on a small creek which makes many leaps down perpendicular terraces of rock.  The falls are supposed to have been the favorite tryst of a Digger chief and his Washoe lady-love.

        <pagetext>FALLEN LEAK LAKE. -- This lake lies one mile south of Lake Tahoe, and about three miles south of Emerald Bay.  It is a beautiful sheet of water two miles in length and a mile in width.  It has an outlet into Lake Tahoe. br  br       SILVER LAKE. -- Silver Lake is a perfect little beauty in its way, but is seldom visited, as it lies high on the side of a mountain which is covered with chaparral.  It is about half as large as Fallen Leaf Lake, from which it is distant two miles in a northwest direction. br  br       CORNELIAN BAY. -- This bay lies north of Tahoe City, and has a smooth, pebbly beach, where are found agates, cornelians, and jasper of several colors.  To sail along the shore the distance from Tahoe City is seven miles. br  br       AGATE BAY. -- Agate Bay is a place similar to that just described. - It lies a short distance west of the Hot Springs. br  br       CRYSTAL BAY. -- This beautiful cove forms the extreme north end of Lake Tahoe, It lies northeast of Hot Springs. br  br       SHAKESPEARE ROCK. -- In sailing round the lake from Tahoe City to Glenbrook several picturesque rocky points, studded with stately pines, will be seen, also Shakespeare Rock, which is a cliff towering high above the level of the lake.  On the face of this cliff are seen ridges, fissures, and patches of color which at a distance resolve themselves into the likeness of the face of the immortal dramatist.

        <pagetext>CAVE ROCK is passed before reaching Glenbrook.  It is about 300 feet in height and seen from the deck of the steamer towers upward like the castle of some  Blue Beard  giant of the Sierras.  It has in its face a yawning cavern some 80 feet in depth.  In this dark cave one might suppose the giant to live. br  br       GLENBROOK is on the east side of the lake near a large cave.  Here are several large saw-mills, owned by Yerington, Bliss   Co., which manufacture an immense quantity of all kinds of lumber.  The mills are furnished with electrical lights.  The mill company have here a narrow-gauge railroad nine miles in length, which carries their lumber and timber to the flumes at the top of the mountain (Eastern Summit), whence it is floated down to the valley near Carson City. br  br       CASCADE MOUNTAIN, at the south end of the lake, is 9,500 feet in height.  Near it are beautiful cascades, and from the top are to be seen a number of small lakes, and much wild and grand mountain scenery. br  br       RUBICON SPRINGS, which lie just over the Western Summit of the Sierras, are easily reached by a good stage road from McKinneys'.  Here, on the headwaters of the Rubicon River, is some of the most charming scenery to be found anywhere in the mountains.  There are innumerable nooks, in which the disposition and proportions of water, foliage, and rugged granite rocks is such that all would seem to have been arranged for the special delectation of the

No invalid ever left them with a feeling of disappointment, however highly they might have been recommended to him.  Besides the places named there are scores of nooks and corners, cliffs, streams, fountains, canyons, and gorges that are not even honored with a name, which in almost any other part of the world would be lauded to the skies, and which would attract swarms of visitors from great distances.  There is not a spot about the lake that would not astound the dweller in the prairies of the West were he placed before it. br  br       Routes to Lake Tahoe. br  br       THE ROUTE FROM TRUCKEE. br  br       Persons in California, or tourists bound East, who wish to visit Tahoe will leave the Central Pacific at Truckee.  The distance to the lake is but fourteen miles, over a good stage-road, which passes along up the Truckee River, amid grand and beautiful scenery.  High, rocky, and picturesque mountains wall in the gorge through which winds the river and the road, and on all sides are groves of stately pines.  In places where the walls recede from the stream are charming little nooks, valleys, and meadows.  Indeed, at every turn in road and river new beauties are disclosed. br  br       There are fresh surprises on every furlong of the road from Truckee to Tahoe City, which town is situated at the outlet of the lake which forms the

        <pagetext>Lake Tahoe Lumber Operations. br       A writer in Appleton's Journal says the lumber interest and the lumbermen sustain Glenbrook, Cal., and all the neighboring settlements.  They are seen nearly everywhere in that beautiful region, which, once clothed from head to foot in pines, is being denuded to supply the Comstock mines with fuel for their hoisting apparatus and supports for their excavations.  Penetrating a pine forest to its heart we find an industrious gang of vandals blasting trees out of beds upon which a tangle of roots seems to have fastened for eternity; and standing upon the foot hills we hear the sibilant grind of the sawmills, the crash of axes, and the dull reverberations of the blast.  Following one of many devious wagon roads -- one out of use, for instance -- a curious litter of chips and shavings represents a forest sacrificed; following another road still in use, we discover the lumbermen at work carrying the havoc further. br  br       On one side of Lake Tahoe a steam railway several miles long is used exclusively in the transportation of logs to the shore; the logs are towed across the water in immense rafts to Glenbrook, where they pass through the sawmills; and thence another steam railway, also used exclusively in the lumber service, extends to the summit of the divide.  Down the eastern slope of the mountains, leading to the Carson river, flumes 20 and 80 miles long are carried over valleys and ravines on high trestle work bridges, and the wood is floated through them over another stage of its journey toward the mines. br  br       One morning as I was riding through Truckee canon, a great wave and a cloud of spray leaped from the river into the air some distance in front of me.  I went a few paces further, when, by the merest chance, my eye caught what was intended to be a sign -- the lid of a baking powder box tacked to a pine stump, and inscribed with dubious letters: ' Look out for the logs '   In which direction the logs were to be looked for was not intimated, and I paused in uncertainty as to whether security depended on my standing still or advancing.  Suddenly my mule shied round, and a tremendous pine log, 80 or 100 feet long, and about five feet in diameter, shot down the almost perpendicular wall of the canon into the river, raising another wave and an avalanche of spray. br  br       This was to me a new phase of the lumber industry.  A wide, strong, V-shaped trough, bound with ribbons of iron which had been worn to silvery brightness by the friction, was laid down the precipice; and out of sight on the plateau above, some men were felling the trees, which they conveyed to the river in the expeditious manner aforesaid.

        <pagetext>Lake Tahoe. br  br  So many reports have spread about concerning the depth of this wondrous sheet of water that but few really know which to accept.  Some reports go to show that no soundings were ever obtained in the center o   the lake, and others that the greatest depth is 2,300 feet. The following, ascertained irom John McKinney, one of the oldest residents on the lake shore, and who assisted in taking the soundings, may prove interesting to the general public : br  br   Fifteen miles of the lake on the State line average 1,400 feet. The center of the line is 1,500 feet deep. Three hundred yards from the mouth of Emerald Bay the water is 790 feet deep, and foul- miles east thereof this soundings are 1,400 feet.  At Rubicon Rock, 300 feet from shore, the water is 850 feet deep, and four miles out, easterly, it reaches 1,480.  At Sugar Pine Point, one-half mile south, the depth is 770 feet, and four miles out, pitching; to the north, 1,500 feet.  Half a mile from Idlewild the depth is 780 feet, and six miles out, 1,525 feet.  At Saxton's old mill, near Tahoe City, 772 feet of water is found one-quarter of a mile from shore, and five miles east by north l,603 feet is reached. At Observatory Point, one-quarter of a mile northeast from Tahoe City, soundings are 1,800 feet, and four miles east 1,640.  Four miles south of Hot Springs 1,645 feet, the greatest depth in the lake, is found.  Blue water in any portion, of the lake averages 1,300 feet. br  br   The temperature of the lake water at 800 feet is found to be 43   ; at 1,506 feet, 80 1/2; at the surface in winter time, the temperature is 44  , and in deep water, during the summer, 65  . The above will doubtless attract both interest and comment, but coming from the source it does, must be entitled to consideration.  The theory of Mr. McKinney as to the original formation of the lake is that it occurred in the glacial period, and not from volcanic action, and if space permitted, his opinions on the subject would be given at this time ; but it is certain that the bottom of the lake is riven, as are the surrounding mountains, into chasms and ravines, leaving plateaus that extend for miles, as do other valleys or land. Could the water be drained from the lake, the bottom would be several hundred feet lower than Carson valley, which valley was undoubtedly caused by the same operation as the lake, and was itself an inland sea or fresh water lake. br  br  A deal of sound sense and deep study is evidenced by Mr. McKinney's theories and argument, and it would be much to the benefit of science if they would be published. -- Carson Tribune

WATSON (To his friends  Bob )    Fearless Explorer, Expert Mountaineer, Peerless Guide, Truthful Fisherman, Humane Hunter,          Delightful Raconteur,   True hearted   Gentleman, Generous Communicator of a large and         varied Knowledge,  Brother    to   Man and Beast and Devoted Friend,    AND TO ANOTHER,    though younger brother of the same craft    RICHARD MICHAELIS    These Pages are Cordially Dedicated    with the Author's High Esteem    and Affectionate Regards.         BOB  WATSON, TAHOE GUIDE, AT HOME, WITH HIS DOG, SKOOKUM JOHN        INTRODUCTION    California is proving itself more and more the wonderland of the United States. Its hosts         of annual visitors are increasing with marvelous rapidity; its population is growing by         accretions from the other states faster than any other section in the civilized world. The         reasons are not far to seek. They may be summarized in five words, viz., climate,         topography, healthfulness, productiveness and all around liveableness. Its climate is         already a catch word to the nations; its healthfulness is attested by the thousands who         have come here sick and almost hopeless and who are now rugged, robust and happy; its         productiveness is demonstrated by the millions of dollars its citizens annually receive         for the thousands of car-loads (one might almost say train-loads) of oranges, lemons,         grapefruit, walnuts, almonds, peaches, figs, apricots, onions, potatoes, asparagus and         other fruits of its soil; and its all around home qualities are best evidenced by the         growth, in two or three decades, of scores of towns from a merely nominal population to         five, ten, twenty, forty or fifty thousand, and of the cities of San Francisco, Los         Angeles and Oakland to metropolises, the two former already claiming populations of half a         million or thereabouts.    As far as its topography, its scenic qualities, are concerned, the world of tourists         already has rendered any argument upon, that line unnecessary. It is already beginning to         rival Switzerland, though that Alpine land has crowded populations within a day's journey         to draw from.    viii                         INTRODUCTION    One has but to name Monterey, the Mt. Shasta region, Los Angeles, San Diego and Coronado,         the Yosemite, Lake Tahoe, the Big Trees, the King and Kern River Divide, Mono Lake and a         score of other scenic regions in California to start tongues to wagging over interesting         reminiscences, whether it be in London, Paris, Berlin, Madrid or Petrograd.    Books galore are being published to make California's charms better known, and it has long         seemed strange to me that no book has been published on Lake Tahoe and its surrounding         country of mountains, forests, glacial valleys, lakes and canyons, for I am confident that         in one or two decades from now its circle of admirers and regular visitors will include         people from all over the civilized world, all of whom will declare that it is incomparable         as a lake resort, and that its infinite variety of charm, delight and healthful allurement         can never adequately be told.    Discovered by the   Pathfinder  Fremont; described in the early days of California history         and literature by John Le Conte, Mark Twain, Thomas Starr King, Ben C. Truman, and later         by John Vance Cheney and others; for countless centuries the fishing haunt of the         peaceable Nevada Washoes, who first called it Tahoe-High or Clear Water - and of the         California Monos; the home of many of their interesting legends and folk lore tales;         occasionally the scene of fierce conflicts between the defending Indians and those who         would drive them away, it early became the object of the jealous and inconsequent         squabbling of politicians. Its discoverer had named it Mountain Lake, or Lake Bonpland,         the latter name after the traveling and exploring companion of Baron von Humboldt, whose         name is retained in the Humboldt River of Nevada, but when the first reasonably accurate         survey of its shores was made, John Bigler was the occupant of the gubernatorial chair of         the      State of California and it was named after him. Then, later, for purely political reasons,         it was changed to Tahoe, and finally back to Bigler, which name it still officially         retains, though of the thousands who visit it annually but a very small proportion have         ever heard that such a name was applied to it. INTRODUCTION                           ix      In turn, soon after its discovery, Tahoe became the scene of a mining excitement that         failed to   pan out,  the home of vast logging and lumber operations and the objective         point to which several famous   Knights of the Lash   drove world noted men and women in         swinging Concord coaches. In summer it is the haunt of Nature's most dainty, glorious, and         alluring picturesqueness; in winter the abode, during some days, of the Storm King with         his cohorts of hosts of clouds, filled with rain, hail, sleet and snow, of fierce winds,         of dread lightnings, of majestic displays of rudest power. Suddenly, after having covered         peak and slope, meadow and shore, with snow to a depth of six, eight, ten or more feet,         the Storm King retires and Solus again reigns supreme. And then  ah, then is the time to         see Lake Tahoe and its surrounding country. The placid summer views are exquisite and         soul stirring, but what of Tahoe now? The days and nights are free from wind and frost,         the sun tempers the cold and every hour is an exhilaration. The American people have not         yet learned, as have the Europeans in the Alps, the marvelous delights and stimulations of         the winter in such a place as Lake Tahoe. But they will learn in time, and though a         prophet is generally without honor in his own country, I will assume a role not altogether         foreign, and venture the assertion that I shall live to see the day when winter visitors         to Lake Tahoe will number more than those who will visit it throughout the whole of the         year (1914) in which I write. One of the surprises often expressed by those I have met         here who have wintered      in the Alps is that no provision is made for hotel accommodation during the winter at Lake         Tahoe.  x                            INTRODUCTION      To return, however, to the charms of Tahoe that are already known to many thousands.         Within the last two or three decades it has become the increasingly popular Mecca of the         hunter, sportsman, and fisherman; the natural haunt of the thoughtful and studious lover         of God's great and varied out of doors, and, since fashionable hotels were built, the         chosen resort of many thousands of the wealthy, pleasure loving and luxurious. What wonder         that there should be a growing desire on the part of the citizens of the United States -         and especially of California and Nevada- together with well informed travelers from all         parts of the world, for larger knowledge and fuller information about Lake Tahoe than has         hitherto been available.    To meet this laudable desire has been my chief incitement in the preparation of the         following pages, but I should be untrue to my own devotion to Lake Tahoe, which has         extended over a period of more than thirty years, were I to ignore the influence the         Lake's beauty has had over me, and the urge it has placed within me. Realizing and feeling         these emotions I have constantly asked with Edward Rowland Sill:    What can I for such a world give back again? And my only answer has been, and is, this:    Could I only hint the beauty - Some least shadow of the beauty, Unto men     In looking over the files of more or less ephemeral literature, as well as the records of         the explorations of early days, I have been astonished at the rich treasures of scientific         and descriptive literature that have Lake Tahoe as their object.  INTRODUCTION                          xi    Not  the  least          service  this unpretentious volume      will  accomplish  is  the  gathering  together of  these  little known jewels.    It will be noticed that I have used the word Sierran rather than Alpine throughout these         pages. Why not? Why should the writer, describing the majestic, the glorious, the sublime         of the later formed mountain ranges of earth, designate them by a term coined for another         and far away range?    I would have the reader, however, be careful to pronounce it accurately. It is not         Sy-eer-an, but See-ehr-ran, almost as if one were advising another to   See Aaron,  the         brother of Moses.    Tahoe is not Teh-o, nor is it Tah-ho, nor Tah-o. The Washoe Indians, from whom we get the         name, pronounce it as if it were one syllable Tao, like a Chinese name, the   a   having         the broad sound ah of the Continent.     Likewise  Tallac is not pronounced with the accent on the last syllable (as is generally         heard), but Tal-ac.    While these niceties of pronunciation are not of vast importance, they preserve to us the         intonations of the original inhabitants, who, as far as we know, were the first human         beings to gaze upon the face of this ever glorious and beautiful Lake.    When Mark Twain and Thomas Starr King visited Tahoe it was largely in its primitive         wildness, though logging operations for the securing of timber for the mines of Virginia         City had been going on for some time and had led to the settlement at Glenbrook (where         four great saw mills were in constant operation so long as weather permitted), and the         stage road from Placerville to Virginia City demanded stopping stations, as Myers, Yanks,         Rowlands and Lakeside.    But today, while the commercial operations have largely ceased, the scenic attractions of         Lake Tahoe and its region      have justified the erection of over twenty resorts and camps, at least two of them         rivaling in extent and elaborateness of plant any of the gigantic resort hotels of either         the Atlantic or Pacific coasts, the others varying in size and degree, according to the         class of patronage they seek. xii                          INTRODUCTION  That these provisions for the entertainment of travelers,         yearly visitors, and health seekers will speedily increase with the years there can be no         doubt, for there is but one Lake Tahoe, and its lovers will ultimately be legion. Already,         also, it has begun to assert itself as a place of summer residence. Fifteen years ago         private residences on Lake Tahoe might have been enumerated on the fingers of the two         hands; now they number as many hundreds, and the sound of the hammer and saw is constantly         heard, and dainty villas, bungalows, cottages, and rustic homes are springing up as if by         magic.    Then Lake Tahoe was comparatively hard to reach. Now, the trains of the Southern Pacific         and the Lake Tahoe Railway and Transportation Company deposit one on the very edge of the         Lake easier and with less personal exertion than is required to go to and from any large         metropolitan hotel in one city to a similar hotel in another city.    It is almost inevitable that in such a book as this there should be some repetition. Just         as one sees the same peaks and lakes, shoreline and trees from different portions of the         Lake - though, of course, at slightly or widely differing angles - so in writing, the         attention of the reader naturally is called again and again to the same scenes. But this         book is written, not so much with an eye to its literary quality, as to afford the visitor         to Lake Tahoe - whether contemplative, actual, or retrospective - a truthful and         comprehensive account and description of the Lake and its surroundings. INTRODUCTION    Xlll      It will be observed that in many places I have capitalized      the common noun Lake. Whenever this appears it signifies Lake Tahoe - the chief of all the         lakes of the Sierras.    While it is very delightful to sit on the veranda or in the swinging seats of the Tavern         lawn, or at the choice nooks of all the resorts from Tahoe City completely around the         Lake, it is not possible to write a book on Lake Tahoe there. One must get out and feel         the bigness of it all; climb its mountains, follow its trout streams; ride or walk or push         one's way through its leafy coverts; dwell in the shade of its forests; row over its         myriad of lakes; study its geology, before he can know or write about Tahoe.    This is what I have done.    And this is what I desire to urge most earnestly upon my reader. Don't lounge around the         hotels all the time. Get all you want of that kind of recreation; then   go in   for the         more strenuous fun of wandering and climbing. Go alone or in company, afoot or horseback,         only go  Thus will Tahoe increase the number of its devoted visitants and my object in         writing these pages be accomplished.

        <pagetext>TAHOE TAVERN , LAKE TAHOE. CALIF.    STEAMER TAHOE OFF CAVE  ROCK, NEVADA SIDE, LAKE TAHOE    THE LAKE OF THE SKY LAKE TAHOE    CHAPTER I    WHY    THE LAKE OF THE SKY   ?    LAKE TAHOE is the largest lake at its altitude - twentythree miles long by thirteen         broad, 6225 feet above the level of the sea - with but one exception in the world. Then,         too, it closely resembles the sky in its pure and perfect color. One often experiences, on         looking down upon it from one of its many surrounding mountains, a feeling of surprise, as         if the sky and earth had somehow been reversed and he was looking down upon the sky         instead of the earth.    And, further, Lake Tahoe so exquisitely mirrors the purity of the sky; its general         atmosphere is so perfect, that one feels it is peculiarly akin to the sky.    Mark Twain walked to Lake Tahoe in the early sixties, from Carson City, carrying a couple         of blankets and an ax. He suggests that his readers will find it advantageous to go on         horseback. It was a hot summer day, not calculated to make one of his temperament         susceptible to fine scenic impressions, yet this is what he says:    We plodded on, two or three hours longer, and at last the Lake burst upon us - a noble         sheet of blue water lifted six thousand three hundred feet above the level of the sea,      and walled in by a rim of snow clad mountain peaks that towered aloft full three thousand         feet higher still. 2       THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE   It was a vast oval, and one would have to use up eighty or a hundred         good miles in traveling around it. As it lay there with the shadows of the mountains         brilliantly photographed upon its still surface I thought it must surely be the fairest         picture the whole earth affords     And there you have it  Articulate or inarticulate, something like this is what every one         thinks when he first sees Tahoe, and the oftener he sees it, and the more he knows it the         more grand and glorious it becomes. It is immaterial that there are lakes perched upon         higher mountain shelves, and that one or two of them, at equal or superior altitudes, are         larger in size. Tahoe ranks in the forefront both for altitude and size, and in beauty and         picturesqueness, majesty and sublimity, there is no mountain body of water on this earth         that is its equal.    Why such superlatives in which world travelers generally - in fact, invariably - agree ?         There must be some reason for it. Nay, there are many. To thousands the chief charm of         Lake Tahoe is in the exquisite, rare, and astonishing colors of its waters. They are an         endless source of delight to all who see them, no matter how insensible they may be,         ordinarily, to the effect of color. There is no shade of blue or green that cannot here be         found and the absolutely clear and pellucid quality of the water enhances the beauty and         perfection of the tone.    One minister of San Francisco thus speaks of the coloring:    When the day is calm there is a ring around the Lake extending from a hundred yards to a         mile from the shore which is the most brilliant green; within this ring there is another         zone of the deepest blue, and this gives place to royal purple in the distance; and the         color of the Lake changes from day to day and from hour to hour. WHY  THE LAKE OF THE SKY ?           3     It is never twice      the same - sometimes the blue is lapis lazuli, then it is jade, then it is purple, and         when the breeze gently ruffles the surface it is silvery gray. The Lake has as many moods         as an April day or a lovely woman. But its normal appearance is that of a floor of lapis         lazuli set with a ring of emerald.    The depth of the water, varying as it does from a few feet to nearly or over 2000 feet,         together with the peculiarly variable bottom of the Lake, have much to do with these color         effects. The lake bottom on a clear wind quiet day can be clearly seen except in the         lowest depths. Here and there are patches of fairly level area, covered either with rocky         bowlders, moss covered rocks, or varicolored sands. boulders Then, suddenly, the eye falls upon a         ledge, on the yonder side of which the water suddenly becomes deep blue. That ledge may         denote a submarine precipice, a hundred, five hundred, a thousand or more feet deep, and         the changes caused by such sudden and awful depths are beyond verbal description.    Many of the softer color effects are produced by the light colored sands that are washed         down into the shallower waters by the mountain streams. These vary considerably, from         almost white and cream, to deep yellow, brown and red. bouldersThen the mosses that grow on the         massive bowlders, rounded, square and irregular, of every conceivable size, that are         strewn over the lake bottom, together with the equally varied rocks of the shoreline,         some of them towering hundreds of feet above the water - these have their share in the         general enchantment and revelry of color.    Emerald Bay and Meek's Bay are justly world-famed for their triumphs of color glories, for         here there seem to be those peculiar combinations of varied objects, and depths, from the         shallowest to the deepest, with the variations of colored sands and rocks on the bottom,         as well as queer     shaped and colored bowlders lying on the varicolored sands, that are not found elsewhere.         The waving of the water gives a mottled effect surpassing the most delicate and         richly shaded marbles and onyxes. boulders 4       THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE     Watered silks of the most perfect manufacture are but         childish and puerile attempts at reproduction, and finest Turkish shawls, Bokhara rugs or         Arab sheiks' dearest prized Prayer Carpets are but glimmering suggestions of what the         Master Artist himself has here produced.    There are not the glowing colors of sunrises and sunsets; but they are equally sublime,         Awe-inspiring and enchanting. There are Alpine glows, and peach blooms and opalescent         fires, gleams and subtle suggestions that thrill moment by moment, and disappear as soon         as seen, only to be followed by equally beautiful, enchanting and surprising effects, and         with it all, is a mobility, a fluidity, a rippling, flowing, waving, tossing series of         effects that belong only to enchanted water - water kissed into glory by the sun and moon,         lured into softest beauty by the glamour of the stars, and etherialized by the quiet and         subtle charms of the Milky Way, Etherealized and of the Suns, Comets and Meteors that the eye of man         has never gazed upon.    There is one especially color blessed spot. It is in Grecian Bay, between Rubicon Point         and Emerald Bay. Here the shore formation is wild and irregular, with deep holes,         majestic, grand and rugged rocks and some trees and shrubbery. Near the center of this is         a deep hole, into which one of the mountain streams runs over a light colored sandy bottom         where the water is quite shallow. Around are varicolored trees and shrubs, and these         objects and conditions all combine to produce a mystic revelation of color gradations and         harmonies, from emerald green and jade to the deepest amythestine or ultra marine. WHY  THE LAKE OF THE SKY ?          5    When         the wind slightly stirs      the surface and these dancing ripples catch the sunbeams, one by one, in changeful and         irregular measure, the eyes are dazzled with iridescences and living color changes         covering hundreds of acres, thousands of them, as exquisite, glorious and dazzling as         revealed in the most perfect peacock's tail feathers, or hummingbird's throat. Over such         spots one sits in his boat spell bound, color entranced, and the ears of his soul listen         to color music as thrilling, as enchanting as melodies by Foster and Balfe, minuets by         Mozart and Haydn, arias by Handel, nocturnes a

        <pagetext>CHAPTER II        FREMONT AND THE DISCOVERY OF  LAKE  TAHOE        LIKE so many other great discoveries that were to have an important effect upon the lives of countless numbers of people, the discovery of Lake Tahoe was accidental.    Nor did its finder comprehend the vast influence it was to possess, not only upon the residents of California and Nevada, but upon the travel loving and sightseeing portion of the population of the whole world.        John C. Fremont, popularly acclaimed   the pathfinder,  was its discoverer, on the 14th day of February, 1844. In the journal of his 1843-44 expedition he thus records the first sight of it:        Accompanied by Mr. Preuss, I ascended to day the highest peak to the right from which we had a beautiful view of a mountain lake at our feet, about fifteen miles in length, and so nearly surrounded by mountains that we could not discover an outlet.        It cannot be deemed out of place in these pages, owing to the significance of the discovery by Fremont, to give a brief account of the exploration and its purposes, in the carrying out of which Tahoe was revealed to the intrepid and distinguished explorer.        Fortunately for us, Fremont left a full story of his experiences in the Nevada country, complete in detail, and as fresh and vivid as if but written yesterday. This account, with illuminating Introduction, and explanatory notes by James U. 13  Smith, from whose pioneer father Smith Valley              is named, was republished in the Second Biennial Report of the Nevada Historical Society, from which, with the kind permission of the secretary, Professor Jeanne Elizabeth Wier, the following extracts are made.       14     THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE          Fremont had already made his first exploration of the Rocky Mountains and South Pass in the summer of 1842. It was in this expedition that, standing on the highest peak of the Rockies, he looked down into the vast area beyond, known as the Great Basin, comprising with its mountain ranges the whole western portion of the continent of North America. This he determined to explore, and it was on this second expedition that Lakes Pyramid and Tahoe, the Truckee River, etc., were discovered.        Later, Fremont made his third western journey, that in which he came into conflict with the Mexican officials of California, became governor of California, and was finally placed under arrest by General Kearny, and taken back to Washington to be tried for mutiny. The results of that unfortunate Kearny conflict are well known.        At the official close of the dispute he made his fourth expedition and finally his fifth, all of which are fully treated in Smucker's and Bigelow's Life of Fremont.        To return now to the second expedition. In the words of Mr. Smith:        The object of the expedition was purely for the purpose of exploring and otherwise getting scientific information about the great territory between the Missouri frontier and the Pacific Ocean. Emigrants were making their way westward to the new Oregon Territory, and hunters and trappers had been visiting portions of that region. Farther north the fur companies had their posts and did a regular business with the trappers and Indians. But little was known about the regions further south, and especially the great territory between the Rocky and Sierra Nevada Mountain chains, and that little was freely adulterated with fiction.        DISCOVERY OF LAKE TAHOE             15        Great Salt Lake was supposed to be a very strange and wonderful lake, the islands of which were covered with woods and flowers, through which roamed all kinds of game, and whose waters were sucked down in a great awe inspiring whirlpool into an underground passage under the mountains and valleys to the distant sea. Another myth, or rather pair of myths, in which geographers placed sufficient faith to give a place on the maps of the time, was the great Buenaventura River, and that semi tropical Mary's Lake, the waters from which found their way through the Sierra Nevadas to San Francisco Bay. Mary's Lake was supposed to be a body of water such as a traveler dreams about, whose clear waters were bordered by meadows ever green, a place on whose shores he could pitch his tent and cast aside all thought or care of the morrow. Fremont counted on this lake as a place where he could recuperate and make ready for a final dash eastward across the unknown country to the Rocky Mountains and thence home to the Mississippi River. Contrast these anticipations with the hardships and fears he encountered while groping his way through the Black Rock Desert, north of Pyramid Lake.        But Fremont was a good leader followed by courageous men, and disappointments did not make weaklings of either him or his men. His party, on leaving Missouri, consisted of thirty-nine men - Creoles, Canadian Frenchmen, Americans, a German or two, a free negro and two Indians. Charles Preuss was Fremont's assistant in topography, and it is likely that he made his sketches, several of which were published in the original report. Another member of the party, and one who joined it in the Rocky Mountains and is of special interest to us, was Christopher Carson, commonly known as   Kit  Carson. Fremont speaks of him in very friendly and flattering terms. At the time of the meeting with Carson, he says:   I had here the satisfaction to meet our good buffalo hunter of 1842, Christopher Carson, whose services I considered myself fortunate to secure again.  On another occasion, when Carson had successfully performed a responsible errand, he says:   Reaching St. Vrain's Fort ... we found ... my true and reliable friend, Kit Carson.         Fremont left Kansas City, Mo., May 29, 1843.  16     THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE        His general route was along the old   Oregon Trail,  then the new   Oregon Trail,  but at many places his route was different. He followed up the Kansas River instead of the Platte. But he crossed the Rocky Mountains over the South Pass, which is that of the Union Pacific Railroad, and was common to the Oregon Trail and the emigrant road to California. During nearly the whole journey to Oregon Fremont divided his party. One part he placed in charge of Fitzpatrick This consisted of the carts with the bulk of the supplies and about half of the men. The other part consisted of a mounted party with packhorses and the howitzer. Fremont, of course, took charge of the latter party, for, traveling light as it did, he was able to make detours covering country he wished to explore, always, however, using the other train as a base of supplies. The course of the other party was generally along the emigrant road to Oregon.        After crossing the Rocky Mountains, Fremont went south with his party to explore Great Salt Lake. Thence he returned north again to the emigrant road, which then followed in a general way the Snake or Lewis River to the Columbia, with the exception of the great bend in northeastern Oregon which was traversed by a shorter route. Along the bank of the Columbia the road followed to the Mission Station at the Dalles, or great narrows of the river. At this point many of the emigrants transferred their baggage to barges and floated with the current to their destination on the Willamette River. Others continued by land down the river. Fremont's division reached the Dalles November 4th. Fitzpatrick's train did not come in until the 21st. The latter left his carts at the mouth of the Walla Walla River according to Fremont's orders; and, after making pack saddles, transferred what was left of his baggage to the backs of his mules for the trip down to the Dalles. In the meantime Fremont, with Preuss and two of the other men, had gone down to Fort Vancouver in canoes. This was the headquarters of the Hudson Bay Company for the West. Here supplies for the return journey were obtained. DISCOVERY OF LAKE TAHOE             17          Having transported these supplies up to the Dalles in              barges propelled by Indians, he was ready to take up the final preparation for the homeward journey. It is best to let him describe these preparations in his own words. He says:          The camp was now occupied in making the necessary preparations for our homeward journey, which, though homeward, contemplated a new route, and a great circuit to the south and southeast, and the exploration of the Great Basin between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada.          Three principal objects were indicated, by report, or by maps, as being on this route, the character or existence of which I wished to ascertain, and which I assumed as landmarks, or leading points, on the projected line of return. The first of these points was the Tlamath Lake, on the tableland between the head of Fall River (this is now called by its French name, the Des Chutes River), which comes to the Columbia, and the Sacramento, which goes to the Bay of San Francisco, and from which lake a river of the same name makes its way westwardly direct to the ocean.          This lake and river are often called Klamet, but I have chosen to write the name according to the Indian pronunciation. The position of this lake, on the line of inland communication between Oregon and California; its proximity to the demarcation boundary of latitude 42 deg.; its imputed double character of lake, or meadow, according to the season of the year; and the hostile and warlike character attributed to the Indians about it; - all make it a desirable object to visit and examine. From this lake our course was intended to be about southeast, to a reported lake called Mary's, at some days' journey in the Great Basin; and thence, still on southeast, to the reputed Buenaventura River, which has a place in so many maps, and countenanced the belief of the existence of a great river flowing from the Rocky Mountains to the Bay of San Francisco. From the Buenaventura the next point was intended to be in that section of the Rocky Mountains which includes the heads of Arkansas River, and of the opposite waters of the California Gulf; and thence down the Arkansas to Bent's Fort, and home.          This was our projected line of return - a great part of it absolutely new to geographical, botanical, and geological science - and the subject of reports in relation to lakes,              rivers, deserts, and savages, hardly above the condition of mere wild animals, which inflamed desire to know what this terra incognita really contained. 18     THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE  It was a serious enterprise, at the commencement of winter, to undertake the traverse of such a region, and with a party consisting only of twenty-five persons, and they of many nations - American, French, German, Canadian, Indian, and colored - and most of them young, several being under twenty-one years of age.          All knew that a strange country was to be explored, and dangers and hardships to be encountered; but no one blenched at the prospect. On the contrary, courage and confidence animated the whole party. Cheerfulness, readiness, subordination, prompt obedience, characterized all; nor did any extremity or peril and privation, to which we were afterward exposed, ever belie, or derogate from, the fine spirit of this brave and generous commencement.          The course of the narrative will show at what point, and for what reasons, we were prevented from the complete execution of this plan, after having made considerable progress upon it, and how we were forced by desert plains and mountain ranges, and deep snows, far to the south and near to the Pacific Ocean, and along the western base of the Sierra Nevada; where, indeed, a new and ample field of exploration opened itself before us.         From these quotations it is evident that Fremont had no idea of entering California at this time. He was simply driven to it by circumstances over which he had no control.        Leaving the Dalles, Fremont followed up the Des Chutes River to its headwaters in southeastern Oregon, thence he crossed over the divide to the waters of the Klamath, which he followed southward to what is known as Klamath Marsh.   This he called   Klamath Lake.         Now started the hunt for Mary's Lake and the San Buenaventura River. The party came down through southeastern Oregon into Nevada, where they camped on the night of December 26, in Coleman Valley, on what is called Twelve Mile Creek, and about eleven miles from the              present California line. DISCOVERY OF LAKE TAHOE              19   It may be noted here that at that time the parallel between Nevada and California on the south and Oregon on the north, was the southern boundary of the territory of the United States. Fremont was, therefore, about to cross into Mexican territory.        He then progressed southward through what are now Washoe, Humboldt, Churchill and Lyon counties, and over the California line into Mono County, back again into Douglas, and thence over the mountains south of Lake Tahoe, but did not find Mary's Lake, nor the places upon which he relied to recruit his animals and give rest to his party. He did, however, find Pyramid Lake. This being the body of water into which the Truckee River flows, and the Truckee being the only outlet to Lake Tahoe, it is well that this portion of the account be given in full. Fremont and Carson were on ahead. The day was January 10, 1843. Fremont writes:        Leaving a signal for the party to encamp, we continued our way up the hollow, intending to see what lay beyond the mountain. The hollow was several miles long, forming a good pass (some maps designate this pass as Fremont Pass, others as San Emidio Canyon), the snow deepened to about a foot as we neared the summit. Beyond, a defile between the mountains descended rapidly about two thousand feet; and, filling up all the lower space, was a sheet of green water, some twenty miles broad (Pyramid Lake). It broke upon our eyes like the ocean. The neighboring peaks rose high above us. One peak, on the eastern side of the lake, rises nearly forty-four hundred feet above the lake, and on the side (toward which Fremont was looking) one peak rises 4925 feet above the lake; and we ascended one of them to obtain a better view.        The waves were curling in the breeze, and their dark green color showed it to be a body of deep water. For a long time we sat enjoying the view, for we had become fatigued with mountains, and the free expanse of moving              waves was very grateful. 20     THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE  It was set like a gem in the mountains, which, from our position, seemed to inclose it almost entirely. At the western end it communicated with the line of basins we had left a few days since; and on the opposite side it swept a ridge of snowy mountains, the foot of the great Sierra. Its position at first inclined us to believe it Mary's Lake, but the rugged mountains were so entirely discordant with descriptions of its low rushy shores and open country, that we concluded it some unknown body of water, which it afterwards proved to be.        On January 13th we followed again a broad Indian trail along the shore of the lake to the southward. For a short space we had room enough in the bottom; but, after traveling a short distance, the water swept the foot of the precipitous mountains, the peaks of which are about 3000 feet above the lake. The trail wound around the base of these precipices, against which the water dashed below, by a way nearly impracticable for the howitzer. During a greater part of the morning the lake was nearly hid by a snowstorm, and the waves broke on the narrow beach in a long line of foaming surf, five or six feet high. The day was unpleasantly cold, the wind driving the snow sharp against our faces; and, having advanced only about twelve miles, we encamped in a bottom formed by a ravine, covered with good grass, which was fresh and green.        We did not get the howitzer into camp, but were obliged to leave it on the rocks until morning. The next morning the snow was rapidly melting under a warm sun. Part of the morning was occupied in bringing up the gun; and, making only nine miles, we encamped on the shore, opposite a very remarkable rock in the lake, which had attracted our attention for many miles. It rose, according to our estimate, 600 feet above the water, and, from the point we viewed it, presented a pretty exact outline of the great pyramid of Cheops. Like other rocks, along the shore, it seemed to be incrusted with calcareous cement. This striking feature suggested a name for the lake, and I called it Pyramid Lake; and though it may be deemed by some a fanciful resemblance, I can undertake to say that the future traveler will find much more striking resemblance between this rock and the pyramids of Egypt              than there is between them and the object from which they take their name. . . . DISCOVERY OF LAKE TAHOE             21          The elevation of this lake above the sea is 4890 feet, being nearly 700 feet higher than the Great Salt Lake, from which it lies nearly west, and distant about eight degrees of longitude. The position and elevation of this lake make it an object of geographical interest. It is the nearest lake to the western rim, as the Great Salt Lake is to the eastern rim of the Great Basin which lies between the base of the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada - and the extent and character of which, its whole circumference and contents, it is so desirable to know.        The Indians then directed him to a river of which he says:        Groves of large cottonwood, which we could see at the mouth, indicated that it was a stream of considerable size, and, at all events, we had the pleasure to know that now we were in a country where human beings could live. Reaching the groves, we found the inlet of a large fresh water stream (the Truckee River), and all at once were satisfied that it was neither Mary's River nor the waters of the Sacramento, but that we had discovered a large interior lake, which the Indians informed us had no outlet. It is about 35 miles long, and, by the mark of the water line along the shore, the spring level is about 12 feet above its present waters.        In the meantime, such a salmon trout feast as is seldom seen was going on in our camp, and every variety of manner in which fish could be prepared - boiled, fried and roasted in the ashes - was put into requisition; and every few minutes an Indian would be seen running off to spear a fresh one. Whether these Indians had seen whites before, we could not be certain; but they were evidently in communication with others who had, as one of them had some brass buttons, and we noticed several other articles of civilized manufacture. We could obtain from them but little information about the country. They made on the ground a drawing of the river, which they represented as issuing from another lake in the mountains three or four days distant, in a direction a little west of south; beyond which, they drew a mountain; and              further still, two rivers; on one of which they told us that people like ourselves traveled. 22     THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE          They still wandered to the south, passing near where Dayton, Nevada, now is, and reaching Bridgeport and Mono and Twin Lakes. Here they struck north and west again and soon had to leave the howitzer. Passing through Antelope Valley they reached Markleeville in deep snow, passed Grover's Springs, entered Faith and Hope Valleys, and here it was Fremont gained his view of Lake Tahoe. It was February 14, 1844.    He says:        The dividing ridge of the Sierra is in sight from this encampment. Accompanied by Mr. Preuss, I ascended today the highest peak to the right  probably Stevens Peak, 10,100 feet above sea level , from which we had a beautiful view of a mountain lake at our feet, about fifteen miles in length, and so entirely surrounded by mountains that we could not discover an outlet  Lake Tahoe . We had taken with us a glass, but though we enjoyed an extended view, the valley was half hidden in mist, as when we had seen it before. Snow could be distinguished on the higher parts of the coast mountains, eastward, as far as the eye could extend. It ranged over a terrible mass of broken snowy mountains, fading off blue in the distance. The rock composing the summit consists of very coarse, dark, volcanic conglomerate; the lower parts appeared to be of a slaty structure. The highest trees were a few scattered cedars and aspens. From the immediate foot of the peak, we were two hours reaching the summit, and one hour and a quarter in descending. The day had been very bright, still, and clear, and spring seemed to be advancing rapidly. While the sun is in the sky the snow melts rapidly, and gushing springs cover the face of the mountain in all exposed places, but their surface freezes instantly with the disappearance of the sun.        I obtained tonight some observations, and the result from these, and others made during our stay, gives for the latitude 38 deg. 41' 57 , longitude 120 deg. 25' 57   the correct longitude for this place is 119 deg. 58' , and rate of the chronometer 25.82.        DISCOVERY OF LAKE TAHOE             23        The next night they encamped on the headwaters of a little creek, where at last the water found its way to the Pacific.    The following morning they started early.        The creek acquired a regular breadth of about 20 feet, and we soon began to hear the rushing of water below the icy surface, over which we traveled to avoid the snow; a few miles below we broke through, where the water was several feet deep, and halted to make a fire and dry our clothes. We continued a few miles further, walking being very laborious without snowshoes.        I was now perfectly satisfied that we had struck the stream on which Mr. Sutter lived; and, turning about, made a hard push, and reached the camp at dark. Here we had the pleasure to find all the remaining animals, 57 in number, safely arrived at the grassy hill near camp; and here, also, we were agreeably surprised with the sight of an abundance of salt. Some of the horse guard had gone to a neighboring hut for pine nuts, and discovered unexpectedly a large cake of very white, fine grained salt, which the Indians told them they had brought from the other side of the mountain; they used it to eat with their pine nuts, and readily sold it for goods.        On the 19th, the people were occupied in making a road and bringing up the baggage; and, on the afternoon of the next day, February 20, we encamped, with the animals and all the materiel of the camp, on the summit of the pass  Carson Pass, at the head of Hope Valley  in the dividing ridge, 1000 miles by our traveled road from the Dalles to the Columbia.        The people, who had not yet been to this point, climbed the neighboring peak to enjoy a look at the valley.        The temperature of boiling water gave for the elevation of the encampment, 9338 feet above the sea.        This was 2000 feet higher than the South Pass in the Rocky Mountains, and several peaks in view rose several thousand feet still higher. Thus, at the extremity of the continent, and near the coast, the phenomenon was seen of a range of mountains still higher than the great Rocky Mountains  themselves.    This  extraordinary   fact  accounts              for the Great Basin, and shows that there must be a system of small lakes and rivers scattered over a flat country, and which the extended and lofty range of the Sierra Nevada prevents from escaping to the Pacific Ocean. 24     THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE   Latitude 38 deg. 44', longitude 120 deg. 28'.  This latitude is that of Stevens Peak, the highest in that ridge, 10,100 feet, and of course he did not go over the top of that peak, when Carson Pass, 1600 feet lower, was in plain view; this pass is the lowest one visible from the route on which they had come; another pass much lower leads out from the other or northern end of Hope Valley, but was not visible from their trail. The summit of Carson Pass is approximately latitude 38 deg. 41' 50 ; longitude 119 deg. 59'. Fremont's longitude readings are unreliable, owing to error in his chronometer.         From this point on, following the south fork of the American River, sixteen days from the summit landed Fremont and his party at Sutter's Fort, March 8. Of their arrival Fremont says:        A more forlorn and pitiable sight than they presented cannot well be imagined. They were all on foot, each man weak and emaciated, leading a horse or mule as weak and emaciated as themselves. They had experienced great difficulty in descending the mountains, made slippery by rains and melting snows, and many horses fell over precipices and were killed, and with some were lost the packs they carried. Among these was a mule with the plants which we had collected since leaving Fort Hall, along a line of 2000 miles of travel. Out of 67 horses and mules, with which we commenced crossing the Sierra, only 33 reached the valley of the Sacramento, and they only in a condition to be led along.        In concluding this chapter it should not be overlooked that on his maps of the expedition of 1843-44 Fremont called the mountain lake he had discovered   Lake Bonpland.  He says in a private letter:   I gave to the basin river its name of Humboldt and to the mountain lake the    name of his companion traveler, Bonpland, and so put it in the map of that expedition.

He was educated as a physician but became a noted botanist. He accompanied Humboldt to America, and subsequently became a joint author with the great traveler and scientist of several valuable works on the botany, natural history, etc., of the New World. He was detained as a prisoner for nearly ten years by Dictator Francia of Paraguay to prevent him from, or to punish him for, attempting to cultivate the mate, or Paraguay tea, in that country. He died in 1858 at Montevideo, the Capital of Uruguay, in South America.        His name as applied to Lake Tahoe is practically unknown, save to the curious investigator or historian. Other names given by Fremont have   stuck   to this day, amongst them being Humboldt, Walker, Owen, Kern and Carson rivers, Pyramid and Walker lakes, etc.        The vicissitudes of the naming of Lake Tahoe is of sufficient interest to occupy a whole chapter, to which the reader is referred.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER III    THE  INDIANS  OF  LAKE  TAHOE    SINCE Lake Tahoe was the natural habitat of one of the most deliciously edible fishes         found in the world, the Indians of the region were bound, very early in their history         here, to settle upon its shores.    These were the Paiutis and the Washoes.    The former,         however, ranging further east in  Nevada, were always regarded as interlopers by the         latter if they came too near to the Lake, and there are legends current of several great         struggles in which many lives were lost, where the Washoes battled with the Paiutis to         keep them from this favored locality.    Prior to the coming of the emigrant bands in the early 'forties of the last century, the         only white men the Indians ever saw were occasional trappers who wandered into the new and         strange land. Then, the beautiful Indian name, soft and limpid as an Indian maiden's eyes,         was Wasiu - not the harsh, Anglicized, Washoe. Their range seemed to be from Washoe and         Carson valleys on the east in winter, up to Tahoe and over the Sierras for fishing and         hunting in the summer. They never ventured far westward, as the Monos and other mountain         tribes claimed the mountain regions for their acorns and the game (deer, etc.), which         abounded there.    While in the early days of the settlements of whites upon their lands the Washoes now and         again rose in protest, and a few lives were lost, in the main they have been a      peaceable and inoffensive tribe. 26    THE INDIANS OF LAKE TAHOE           27   The Paiutis were far more independent and warlike,         placing their yoke upon the weaker tribe. Indeed, when I first talked with the older         Washoes and Paiutis thirty years ago they were full of stories of big wars between         themselves. They showed me rocks near to the present town of Verdi, on the line of the         Southern Pacific, on which their ancestors had made certain inscriptions which they         interpreted as warnings to the Paiutis not to dare trespass beyond that sign, and the         Paiutis had similar notices inscribed upon bowlders near to their boundary lines. As a         result of one of their fights the Washoes were forbidden the use of horses, and it is only         since the whites have exercised control that the weaker tribe has dared to disregard this         prohibition.    Today they number in the region of six hundred men, women and children. On account of         their nomadic habits it is impossible to secure a complete census.    In appearance they are heavy and fat, though now and again a man of fine, muscular form         and good height is found. The women have broad, shapeless figures and clumsy, deliberate         movements. The older they get the more repulsive and filthy they become. While young some         of the women have pleasing, intelligent and alert faces, while children of both sexes are         attractive and interesting. But with them as with all aboriginal people who have absorbed         the vices and none of the virtues of the whites, the Washoes are fast losing power, vigor         and strength by disease and dissipation. The smoke of the campoodie fire is also ruinous         to their eyes and ophthalmia is prevalent among them. It is no uncommon thing to see a man         or woman entirely blind.    The old time methods of clothing have entirely disappeared. When I first knew them it was         not unusual to find an old Indian wrapped in a blanket made of twisted rabbit skins, but I         doubt if one could be found today. 28     THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE    The white      man's overalls, blouse and ordinary coat and vest for the men, with calico in variegated         colors for the women, seem to have completely taken the place of their own primitive         dress. A pair of moccasins, however, now and again, may be found in use at a dance or on         some special occasion.    They still paint and tattoo their faces, hands and wrists, in lines, triangles and         circles. On their bodies also stripes of irregular design and varying colors are often         used, all having a symbolic meaning originally, now lost, however, at least to all the         younger members of the tribe. Painting the face has a definite and useful purpose. It         softens the skin and prevents the frosts of winter from cracking it.    Their dwellings are of the rudest character, mere brush shacks in summer, and in winter,         nondescript structures of brush, old boards, railroad ties, tin cans, barrel staves, old         carpet, canvas, anything that will sustain a roof and keep out wind, rain and as much of         the cold as possible. Their name for this structure is campoodie. Of course there is no         pretense of sanitation, cleanliness or domestic privacy. The whole family herds together         around the smoking fire, thus early beginning the destruction of their eyesight by the         never ceasing and irritating smoke.    Their native food consists of fish, the products of the chase, which include deer,         antelope, an occasional bear, rabbits, squirrels and even coyotes, mountain lions and         wildcats, with acorns, manzanita berries, currants and the seeds of wild peaches and the         various grasses, together with a large assortment of roots. While they gather and eat pine         nuts, they generally save them for purposes of barter or sale. Their carrying baskets         contain a good wheelbarrow load and are called mo-ke-wit.    They are great gamblers, their chief game being a guessing contest, where sides are         chosen, the fortune of each side depending on its ability to guess who holds a certain         decorated stick.

Quiet chanting or singing often accompanies the game. All alike smoke         the cigarette.    Of their religious beliefs little can be said. The fact is their simple nature worship and         the superstitions connected with it have been abolished, practically, by their association         with the whites, and we have given them nothing as substitutes.    As Mrs. W. W. Price         says in a letter to me:    In several talks with Susan and Jackson, after the death of Susan's sister, I endeavored         to find out some of their religious beliefs. But these talks were not very satisfactory.         Neither one knew what he did believe. Their old Indian religion - whatever it may have         been - seemed to have passed, and the religion of the white man had not taken very deep         hold.    While Susan felt that she must cut her hair short and burn all her sister's things and do         just so much wailing each day to drive off the evil spirits (on the occasion of her         sister's death), she took most comfort in doing as   white woman   do - putting on a black         dress.    The most interesting result of my talks with Jackson was the following ghost story, which         he told me to show that Indians sometimes did live again after death. His grandmother had         told him the story and had heard it herself from the man to whom it had happened. It is as         follows :   An Indian woman died, leaving a little child and her husband. The latter spent         the accustomed four days and nights watching at her grave without food or drink. On the         fourth night the grave suddenly opened and the woman stepped out before him. ' Give me my         child,' said she. The man said not a word but went quickly and brought the little child.         The woman did not speak but took the child and suckled it. Then holding it close in her         arms, she began to walk slowly away. The man followed her, but he did not speak. On, on         they went, through forest and meadow, uphill and down dale. 30     THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE        By and by the man made a movement as though he would      take hold of her to stop her. But the woman warded him off with a wave of her hand. '         Touch me not,' she said. ' If you touch me, you must die too ' She stood and suckled the         child once more, then laid him gently in her husband's arms. ' Go home,' she said, and         faded from his sight.      Home he went with the child, full of awe and fear.      A few days afterwards the child died, though there was nothing the matter with it. The         man, however, lived to be very old.     Jackson was not sure whether he believed this story or not. But his manner of telling it         indicated that it was very real to him.    Now and again near Tallac one may see one of the dances of the Washoes. Though war is past         with them they still occasionally indulge in their War Dance and its consequent Scalp         Dance. There are not more than ten or a dozen of the old warriors still living who         actually engaged in warfare in the old days, and these are too old and feeble to dance.         But as the young men sing and throw their arms and limbs about in the growing frenzy of         the arousing dance, and the tom-tom throbs its stimulating beat through the air, these old         men's eyes flash, and their quavering voices become steady and strong in the excitement,         and they live in the conflicts of the past.    Another of the dances that is still kept up is the Puberty Dance. Many white people have         seen this, but not having any clue to its significance, it seemed absurd and frivolous.         When a girl enters the door of young womanhood the Washoe idea is to make this an occasion         for developing wiriness, strength, and vigor. Contrary to the method of the white race,         she is made, for four consecutive days, to exert herself to the utmost. She must walk and         climb mountains, ride and run, and when night comes on the fourth day, she and her mother,         and as many of the tribe as are available,    THE INDIANS OF LAKE TAHOE          31    begin to dance at sunset and keep it up all night. The girl herself is designated by a         long and slim pole which she carries in her hand, and which towers above her head. By her         side stands her mother. The leader of the dance begins a song, a simple, rhythmic, weird         chant, the words of which are archaic and have no significance to the Indians of today,         but merely give syllables to hang the tune upon. As the leader sings he slowly moves his         legs in a kind of oblique walk. The young men take his hand and follow. The women unite,         and a rude circle is made, generally, however, open, at the place where the dance leader         stands. After once or twice around, the leader moves first one foot, then the other,         sideways, at the same time jogging his body up and down in fairly rapid movement, in         perfect time to his song. In a few moments all are bobbing up and down, with the onward         side shuffling movement, and the real dance is on. This continues according to the will of         the leader. When, his voice gives a sudden drawling drop that dance ends. There are a few         minutes for relaxation and breath, and then he lines out a new song, with new syllables,         and a new dance begins. This continues practically all night, the dance leader showing his         memory power or his composing genius by the number of new songs he introduces. I have         counted as many as thirty to forty different tunes on one occasion.    Just at sunrise the mother of the girl fetches one or two buckets of cold water, while the         maiden undresses. The water is suddenly dashed over her   to make her vigorous and         strong,  and the dance comes to an end.    This rude and rough treatment, in the early days, was made to have all the potency and         sanctity of a religious right. The reason for it was clear. The Washoes were surrounded by         people with whom they were often at war. Indian warfare takes no cognizance of sex or its         special disabilities. 32     THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE     In      order that their women should not be regarded as hors de combat, or enfeebled, at such         times and thus hamper the movement of the tribe in case a sudden flight was needed, the         shamans or medicine men taught that strength, activity and vigor were just as possible at         that time as any other.   Those Above   commanded that it be so. Hence all the sanctity         and seriousness of a religious right was thrown around these dances, and though the Indians         of today have lost many of their old customs, this is one that is still rigorously         observed.    Another singular custom that still obtains is where, after the birth of a first child, the         husband and father is required to fast and work arduously from the day of the birth until         the child's navel shrivels off. This is to make him strong and vigorous, so that he may be         able to give as much strength to his second and later children as he did to the first.    As soon as a girl matures she is marriageable. Several and simple are the ways in which a         Washoe youth shows his preference and desire for marriage. Equally simple are the girl's         signs of acceptance or rejection. There is no ceremony as the White Race understands that         term, though to the Indian there is everything that is necessary to make the right as         binding as it is to his white brother and sister.    Though polygamy has always been practiced, the custom today limits the wives to two, and         only a few men have more than one wife. Where plural wives are taken they are generally         sisters. There is little intermarriage among other tribes. Though it occasionally occurs         it is fiercely frowned upon and all parties are made to feel uncomfortable.    Prostitution with the whites and Chinese is not uncommon, and children born of such         relationship have just as good a standing as those born in wedlock. The Indian sees no         sense in punishing an innocent child for what it is in no way responsible for.    He         frankly argues that only a silly      fool of a white man or woman would do so cruel and idiotic a thing. THE INDIANS OF LAKE TAHOE           33      Children are invariably welcomed and made much of at birth, though it is seldom a Washoe         woman has more than four or five babies. They are always nursed by the mother, and not         often weaned until they are four or five years old.    In the early days the labor of the sexes was clearly defined. The man was the hunter and         the warrior, the guardian of the family. The woman was the gatherer of the seeds, the         preparer of the food, the care taker of the children. Today there is not much difference         in the division of labor. The breaking down of all the old customs by contact with the         whites has made men and women alike indifferent to what work they do so that the family         larder and purse are replenished thereby.    In the early days the Washoes were expert hunters of bear and deer. They used to cross         over into the mountains of California for this purpose, and the women would accompany         them. A camp would be established just below the snow line, and while the men and youths         went out hunting the women gathered acorns. My informant, an old Indian, was a lad of         eighteen at the time of which he spoke. In effect he said:   One day while I was out I         found the tracks of a bear which I followed to a cave. Then I went to camp. But we Indians         are not like you white men. You would have rushed in and shouted to everybody, ' I've         found a bear's track ' Instead I waited until night and when all the squaws had gone to         bed I leisurely told the men who were chatting around the camp fire. They wished to know         if I knew where the cave was, and of course I assured them I could go directly to it. The         next morning early my uncle quietly aroused me, saying, ' Let's go and get that bear.' I         was scared but had to go. When we arrived he took some pieces of pitch pine from his         pocket, and lighting them, gave      me one, and told me to stand at the mouth of the cave ready to shoot the bear, while he         went in and drove it out. 34     THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE   I didn't like the idea, but I daren't confess my cowardice, for         he at once went in. In a few moments I heard terrific growlings and roarings and then the         bear rushed out. I banged away and he fell, and I was proud to tell my uncle, when he came         out, that I had killed the bear. ' No, you didn't,' said he; ' your shots all went wild.         Here's the shot that killed him,' and sure enough it was a shot of a different size from         that of my gun.      Another time when I found a bear in a cave he said, ' You must go in this time and drive         out the bear.' I was sure I couldn't do it, but he insisted, and thrusting the lighted         sticks into my hands bade me crawl in, keeping my eyes fixed the while, as soon as I saw         them, upon those of the bear. I was to keep my back to the wall, and when I got well in,         was to dash the light behind the bear and give a yell. I crawled in all right and soon got         to where I could just about stand up, but when I saw the bear and he began to growl I was         scared and backed out pretty quick and said I didn't have light enough. My uncle grabbed         the sticks from me, called me a coward, rushed in, and as the bear dashed out shot and         killed it.     It is generally thought that Indians are good shots, but the testimony of the hunters of         the Tahoe region is that the Washoes are very poor shots. One hunter tells me he has seen         an Indian take as fine a standing shot as one need desire, again and again, and miss every         time. On one occasion he was hunting deer with an Indian. The latter had gone up a steep         slope, when, suddenly, he began to fire, and kept it up until fourteen shots were fired.         Said he:  I was sure he must have a bunch of deer and was making a big killing, and         hurried up to his side. When I got there I found he had sent all those shot after one         buck, and had      succeeded only in breaking its leg. THE INDIANS OF LAKE TAHOE           35   With one shot I killed the wounded animal, went up to         it and was about to cut its throat, when he begged me not to do so, asserting that if I         cut the deer's throat that way I should never get a standing shot again, the deer would         always be able to smell me.     This is a quaint superstition. The Indians believe that though the particular deer be         slain it has the power of communicating with living deer and informing them of the         peculiar   smell   of the hunter. Hence, as in the olden days they had no guns, only bows         and arrows, and were compelled to creep up much nearer to their prey than is needful with         a gun, anything that seemed to add to the deer's power of scenting the hunter must         studiously be avoided.    And, although the gun had rendered the old methods of hunting unnecessary, this particular         precaution still persisted and had all the force of established custom.    My friend then continued:   Another superstition I found out as I cleaned this deer. I cut         out the paunch, the heart and the liver and offered them to the Indian. He refused them,         saying it was food fit only for women, children and old men. If he were to eat them he         would never have luck in hunting again.     This superstition is common with many Indian tribes. It is based upon the idea that one         becomes like that which he eats. If one eats the heart of a mountain lion or bear he         becomes daring and courageous. But to eat the heart of the timid deer is to make oneself         timorous and cowardly.    As soon after puberty as possible a boy is taken out by his father or uncle on a hunt.         Prior to that time he is not allowed to go. But before he can eat of the product of the         chase he must himself kill a deer with large enough horns to allow him to crawl through         them.    A friend of mine was out with a Washoe Indian whose boy was along on his first hunting         expedition. 36     THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE      They hunted      a deer for nearly three days, but as soon as they found tracks the father, after studying         them awhile, said:   This a little fellow. No good. He not big enough   - thus signifying         to his son that his horns were not large enough to allow him to crawl through, hence it         was no use following the animal further.    The Indian is quite sure that deer can smell him and know when he is on the hunt. He         becomes skillful in detecting and following their tracks, and knows just how to circle         around their hiding place and suddenly walk in upon them. My friend, referred to above,         who is a great hunter, was once out with a Washoe. They had had three   bad   days, when         suddenly they found a deer's track. It was fresh, but when they came to the hole where he         had lain down to rest, though the place was quite warm, the deer had gone. The Indian at         once exclaimed:   That deer smell me. I must get rid of the Indian smell.  Accordingly he         scooped out a hole in the ground, heated a number of rocks in it, then, spreading fir         boughs over them, lay down over the rocks and took a   fir sweat  for fully ten to fifteen         minutes. As he arose he exclaimed:   Deer no smell me tomorrow,  and my friend said he         did no longer smell like an Indian, but like burnt fir wood.    Turning to the Indian, however, he said:   You're all right, but how about me?  to which         the reply instantly came:   You all right. Deer only smell Indian. He not smell white         man.     Chief among the women's work is the making of baskets. The best Washoe basket makers are         not surpassed by any weavers in the world. At Tallac, Fallen Leaf, Glen Alpine and several         other resorts basket makers may be found, preparing their splints, weaving or trying to         sell their baskets.    Not far from Tahoe Tavern, about a quarter a mile away in the direction of Tahoe City, is         the little curio store of      A Cohn, whose headquarters are in Carson City, the capital of the State of Nevada. THE INDIANS OF LAKE TAHOE          37   Mr.         and Mrs. Cohn hold a unique position in their particular field. Some twenty-five years ago         they purchased a beautiful basket from a Washoe Indian woman, named Dat-so-la-le in         Washoe, or Luisa Keyser in American, for she was the wife of Charley Keyser, a general         roustabout Indian, well known to the citizens of Carson. Luisa was a large, heavy, more         than buxom - literally a fat,- ungainly squaw. But her ringers were under the perfect         control of a remarkably artistic brain. She was not merely an artist but a genius. She saw         exquisite baskets in her dreams, and had the patience, persistence and determination to         keep on weaving until she was able to reproduce them in actuality. She also was possessed         by an indomitable resolution to be the maker of the finest baskets of the Washoe tribe.         While she was still a young woman she gained the goal of her ambition, and it was just         about this time that she offered one of her baskets to Mr. Cohn. He saw it was an         excellent basket, that the shape was perfect, the color harmony superior to any he had         seen before, the stitch small, fine, and even, the weave generally perfect, the design         original and worked out with artistic ability. He saw all this, yet, because it was Indian         work, and the woman was a rude, coarse mountain of flesh, a feminine Falstaff, of a lower         order of beings and without Falstaff's geniality and wit, he passed the basket by as         merely worth a dollar or two extra, and placed it side by side with the work of other         Washoe and Paiuti squaws. A Salt Lake dealer came into the store soon thereafter and saw         this basket.   How much ?  he asked. The price was given - rather high thought Mr. Cohn-.           Twenty-five dollars      I'll take it   came the speedy response.    A month or two later Cohn received a photograph from the purchaser, accompanied by a         letter. 38     THE LAKE OF THE SKY -LAKE TAHOE       You know the      basket, herewith photographed, which I purchased from you. Have you any more by the same         weaver, or of as good a weave? If so, how many, and at what price? Wire reply at my         expense.     Then Mr. Cohn awoke, and he's been awake ever since. He wired his list of Dat-so-la-le's         baskets, but he has had no reply, and that was twenty-five years ago. He then made         arrangements with Dat-so-la-le and her husband. He provides them house, food, clothing and         a certain amount of cash yearly, and he takes all the work Luisa makes. Every basket as         soon as begun is noted as carefully as every breeding of a thoroughbred horse or dog. Also         the date the basket is finished. It is then numbered and photographed and either offered         for sale at a certain price, which is never changed, or is put in the safety deposit vault         of the bank, to await the time when such aboriginal masterpieces will be eagerly sought         after by the growingly intelligent and appreciative of our citizens, for their museums or         collections, as specimens of work of a people - the first American families - who will         then, possibly, have passed away. The photographs, here reproduced, are of some of         Dat-so-la-le's finest work.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER IV   INDIAN   LEGENDS   OF  THE  TAHOE  REGION   AS all students of the Indian are well aware these aboriginal and out-of-door dwellers in the forests, canyons, mountains, valleys, and on lake and seashores are great observers of Nature, and her many and varied phenomena. He who deems the Indian dull, stolid and unimpressionable, simply because in the presence of the White Race he is reserved and taciturn, little knows the observing and reflecting power hidden behind so self-restrained a demeanor. Wherever natural objects, therefore, are of a peculiar, striking, unusual, unique, or superior character, it is reasonable to assume that the Indians, living within sight of them, should possess myths, legends, folk-lore, creation-stories or the like in connection with their creation, preservation, or present-day existence. This is found exemplified in the legends of Havasupais, Hopis, Navajos and Wallapais as to the origin of the Grand Canyon of Arizona, of the Yohamities, Monos, Chuc-Chances, and others, of the distinctive features of the Yosemite Valley, the Hetch-Hetchy, etc.   While the present-day, half-educated, half-civilized Washoes are by no means representatives of the highest elements of natural enlightenment among the Indian race, they do possess legends about Tahoe, the following being the most interesting.   All these stories, except the last, were gathered by Mrs.   39      4o     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   W. W. Price of Fallen Leaf Lodge, from Indians with whom she has been very familiar for several years, named Jackson and his wife Susan. There has been no attempt to dress them up in literary fashion. They are given as near to the Indians' mode of telling as possible. They are wonderfully different from certain stories recently published in current magazines, professing to be Legends of Lake Tahoe. These latter are pure fiction, and to those familiar with Indian thought, reveal their origin in the imaginative brain of white writers who have but faint conceptions of Indian mentality. Mrs. Price is a graduate of Stanford University, and took great pains to preserve the Indians' exact mode of expression.    As she herself writes:   Long before the white man saw and wondered over the beauty of Tahoe, theorizing over its origin and concocting curious tales about its   unfathomable   depths, the Indians knew and loved it. And as among all other peoples, legends have grown up to account for every phenomenon of Nature, so among the Washoe Indians stories about Tahoe have been handed down from generation to generation.   I do not vouch for these legends. The modern Indian too often tells what he thinks you want to know,    if only you will cross his hand with silver. But there are touches here and there that make me feel that for the most part they are remnants of very old legends.   THE   ORIGIN   OF  TAHOE,   FALLEN   LEAF,  AND  OTHER   LAKES   Long, long ago, before the white man came to Nevada, there lived in the meadow over beyond Glenbrook a good Indian. But though he was good, he was much annoyed by the Evil Spirit, who constantly interfered with all that he tried to do. Finally, he determined that he must move away and get over into the valleys of California. But when he tried to escape, the Evil One was always there ready to trip him in some way or other.   In his trouble the Good Spirit came to his aid, giving him a leafy branch which had certain magic qualities.    He was   INDIAN LEGENDS OF TAHOE REGION     41   to start on his journey. If he saw the Evil One coming he was to drop a bit of the branch and water would immediately spring up. The Evil One could not cross water, and thus, being delayed by going around, would give the Indian time to escape.   The Indian made his way well along to where Tallac Hotel now is, when, looking back, he saw the Evil One off in the distance approaching with such strides that his heart was filled with great fear. In his terror he tried to pluck a leaf but it snapped off and he dropped almost his whole branch. To his delight and relief the waters began to rise and soon   Tahoe     Big Water     lay between him and his enemy.   Free-heartedly he hurried on his way up the canyon, but when he reached the spot where the head of Fallen Leaf Lake lies, he turned to reassure himself. Away off the Evil One was advancing. A new terror filled his soul. In his hand there remained of his magic branch only one little twig with a single leaf on it.   Plucking the leaf, he threw it down and watched it fall waveringly through the air. As it touched earth the waters again began to rise and  Doolagoga    Fallen Leaf     sprang into being and on its surface floated the little leaf, as many leaves now float in the fall of the year.   Turning, he sped up the ravine, dropping bits of his twig as fear directed him, and in his path, Lily, Grass, and Heather lakes came up to guard his way.   At last he was over the crest of the mountain and found himself safe in the long-wished-for Valley of California.   THE   LEGEND  OF  THE  TWO  BROTHERS   Once long ago in Paiuti-land, Nevada, there lived two brothers. The older was a hunter and brought home much game. His wife, whose name was Duck, used to cook this for him, but she was very stingy to the younger brother, and often times he was hungry. When he begged her for food, she scolded him and drove him out of the campoodie, saying,   Got none for you.    One day when the older brother, was off hunting Duck was cleaning some fish.    She had been very cross to Little   42     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Brother, refusing to give him any food, and he was terribly hungry. Presently he came creeping up behind her and when he saw all the fish he became very angry. He took up a big club and before Duck could turn around he hit her on the head and killed her. Paying no attention to her dead body he cooked and ate all the fish he wanted and then lay down in the sunshine on a big rock and went fast asleep.   By and by his Hunter Brother came home. Of course when he found his wife dead, he was filled with great anger at his young brother, though his anger was lessened when he thought of his wife's cruelty. He shook him very roughly and said,  I no like you any more  I go away. Leave you alone   But Little Brother begged,  Don't be angry  Don't be angry  Let's go far away  I help you all the time     Don't be angry      Gradually he persuaded the Hunter Brother to forgive him and they started off together toward the   Big Water       Lake Tahoe. On the way the Hunter Brother taught the Little Brother how to shoot with a bow and arrow. By the time they reached the spot now known as Lakeside both their belts were filled with squirrels that they had shot.   At dusk they built a good fire and when there were plenty of glowing coals, Hunter Brother dug a long hole, and filling it with embers, laid the squirrels in a row on the coals covering them all up with earth.   He was tired and lay down by the fire to rest till the squirrels should be cooked. With his head resting on his arms, the warmth of the fire soothing him, he soon fell fast, fast asleep.   Little Brother sat by the fire and as the night grew darker, he grew hungrier and hungrier. He tried to waken his brother, but the latter seemed almost like one dead and he could not rouse him. At last he made up his mind he would eat by himself. Going to the improvised oven, he began to dig up the squirrels, counting them as they came to light.    One was missing.    Little Brother was troubled.     How that ?   My brother had so many, I had so many      INDIAN LEGENDS OF TAHOE REGION     43       counting on his fingers     One gone    And he forgot how hungry he was as he dug for the missing squirrel.   All at once he came upon a bigger hole adjoining the cooking hole. While he stood wondering what to do, out popped  a great big spider.     I'll catch you    cried the spider.    No, you won't   said the boy, and up he jumped and away he ran, followed by the spider. They raced over stock and stone, dodging about trees and stumbling over fallen logs for a long time. At last Little Brother could run no more. The spider grabbed him and carried him back to his hole, where he killed him.   It was almost daybreak when Hunter Brother awoke. He called his brother to bring more wood, for the fire was almost out. Getting no answer he went to look at the cooking squirrels.   Greatly surprised to see them lying there all uncovered, he, too, counted them. Discovering one gone, he thought his brother must have eaten it and was about to eat one himself when he saw the old spider stick his head out of the hole. Each made a spring, but the Hunter Brother was the quicker and killed the wicked spider with his knife.   Carefully he now went into the spider's hole. There, stretched out on the ground, lay Little Brother dead  Taking him up in his arms, he carried him outside. Now this Hunter Brother was a medicine-man of great power, so he lay down with Little Brother and breathed into his mouth and in a few minutes he came back to life and was all right.1   The Hunter Brother was very happy to have his Little Brother alive again. He built up the fire and while they sat eating their long-delayed meal Little Brother told all that had happened to him.   The sun was quite above the horizon before the meal was finished, and soon Hunter Brother was anxious to be moving on, so they took their way along the lake shore. On their way they talked and laughed one with another and seemed to agree very well, until they had gone around the   1 Susan who was telling this story offered no reason why he had not restored Duck, his own wife, to life.   44     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   lake and reached where Tahoe City now is. Here they quarreled and the Hunter Brother left Little Brother to return and go up the Big Mountain     Tallac     where he had heard there were many squirrels. After his departure, Little Brother decided to follow him and get him to make friends again. So he trudged along the lake shore until he came to Emerald Bay.   There lying on the log at the edge of the lake, lay a water-baby. It was asleep with its head resting on its arms and its beautiful, sunshine-golden-hair was spread over it.     Oh,  said Little Brother,   I'll get that beautiful sunshine-hair as a present for my brother    So he crept very softly down on the log, thinking to kill the water-baby before it awoke. But he was not successful in this, for the creature opened its eyes as he laid his hand on its hair, and a furious fight ensued. Sometimes it seemed as though Little Brother would be killed, but finally he was able to scalp the poor water-baby and get possession of the beautiful sunshine-golden-hair. Every one can see where this fight occurred. The red hill near Emerald Bay stands as a memorial of the struggle, for its color is caused by the blood of the slain water-baby.   Tucking his prize in his hunting shirt and hugging it close, Little Brother now went on, murmuring to himself,   Oh, my brother like this, my brother like this beautiful golden-sunshine-hair      But suddenly, as he was climbing upward, he noticed the water lapping at his heels, and when he turned to see whence it came, he found that the big lake behind him was rapidly rising, and even as he stood wondering, it arose above his ankles.   Then he remembered what he had heard of revengeful water-babies, but frightened though he was, he could not bear to throw away his prize. However, he knew he must do something, so he plucked out a few hairs from the scalp and threw them into the ascending waves. For a minute the water ceased to rise and he sped onward, but before long he felt the water at his heels again, and knew that once more he must gain a short respite by throwing out a few of the golden-sunshine-hairs.   INDIAN LEGENDS OF TAHOE REGION     45   And ever and again he had to do this until at last he spied his brother ahead of him.   Ah, brother,  he cried, drawing the scalp from his blouse,   see what a beautiful present I have for you      But when his brother turned toward him he saw only the angry, rising waters, and rushing forward he snatched the beautiful sunshine-golden-hair and cast it back into the waters, crying,   How you dare meddle with water-babies? Don't you know water surely come up and get you?    And poor Little Brother felt very sad; but the danger he had been in seemed to have endeared him once more to Hunter Brother and they stood arm-in-arm and watched the waters recede.   But there were hollows in the land and when the waters went back they held the water and so were formed that chain of lakes on the other side of Tallac and Emerald Bay, the Velmas, Kalmia, Cascade, and others.   The rest of the story is confused and full of repetitions. The gist of it is that Little Brother was ever getting into trouble from which Hunter Brother had to rescue him, for which Little Brother was most grateful and would go off seeking for a present to give to the Big Brother who was so kind to him.   Once he got a young bear cub. He thought it was a dog. He petted it and brought it to his brother as a hunting-dog.   Finally, after Hunter Brother had made a first-class hunter of Little Brother so that he could use his bow and arrows with great success, they went down toward the Sacramento Valley hunting deer. They followed a fine buck over hill and dale but could not get a good shot at him. At last worn out by running and suffering greatly, the Little Brother lay down and died. When his brother found him, he did not attempt to bring him to life again but buried him under a pile of rocks and leaves.   THE    WILD-GRUB    HOLE  AT GARDNERVILLE   Once upon a time there was an old Indian who lived over in Hope Valley with his two grand-daughters. He was a mean old man.    He made the girls work very hard all day   46     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   long. They had to gather wild grass seeds and acorns and grind them into flour all the time. The old man caught plenty of fish and frogs which he took off for his own eating, but he gave the girls none.   One day he came in with a woodchuck skin and told the girls to fill it with wild wheat flour. He did not tell them what he wanted it for. When the skin was full he left the campoodie without a word as to where he was going. But the bag leaked and a little stream of flour trickled out and marked his path. He went away off to a lake where he caught plenty of fish and frogs on which he feasted until he could eat no more. Then he lay down by his fire and was soon fast asleep.   Meanwhile in the campoodie the two girls were talking about the old man's meanness.   He makes us work so hard and we never have any fish to eat. He keeps it all himself,  said the older girl.     I wonder where he's gone now ?   said the younger one, going to the door-way and looking out. Suddenly she noticed the little line of flour trailing off through the woods.   Ah, now I'll find him    And just calling to her sister that she would be back soon, she darted off.   It was dark when she came back weeping. She threw herself on the ground outside the campoodie and poured out her story. She had found the old man lying there fast asleep, gorged with fish. The remnants of his feast lay all about him. She had not dared to waken him or speak to him, but coming home, had made up her mind to run away and not work for the mean old man any more.   To this the sister agreed, and at daybreak they were scurrying off through the forest.   All day they traveled and when night came they were still in the wilds far from any Indian camp.   Worn out, they lay down under a great pine and looked   up at the stars.     Oh,  said the older girl,   see that fine Star-man up there     I'd like to marry him        Oh, no    said the younger,   he belongs to me. I'd like to marry him      They lay there telling what each would do could she only marry the Star-man, until they fell asleep.   INDIAN LEGENDS OF TAHOE REGION     47.   When they awoke in the morning, lo, they found themselves up in the sky, and the elder girl had a baby already     a star-baby  At first the girls were very good to the star-baby but it cried a great deal. One day the younger girl was very cross and put it outside of the campoodie. The poor baby cried all the more until the elder sister took pity on it, but when she had fed it and it still cried, the younger sister became very angry and told her sister to put that   brat  outside. The sister was tired too, so she put the poor baby outside.   When the baby could not make them come to him, he got up and went to find his grandfather, the Moon. He told him how mean his mother and aunt were to him. The old Moon was very angry. He took the star-baby by the hand and went tramping back through the sky to find the cruel mother and her sister.   Now, the girls had been getting rather tired of their shy-campoodie and they longed for their home on the earth. They used to go to a hole in the sky and look down on the earth, wishing they were there again. Indeed, at the time the star-baby went off to find his grandfather, the Moon, they were at the hole in the sky, amusing themselves by looking through and indulging in vain regrets that they were no longer there.     Oh, sister,  suddenly said the elder,   there goes our old grandfather  Poor old man  I wish we were with him  See, he's carrying big bags of wild wheat-flour and acorns      Just then the old Moon came tramping up, and the whole sky trembled. The people on earth said it was thundering. He grabbed the two girls by their hair and shaking them till they were almost dead, he hurled them down through the hole.   Down, down, they went, straight down to where their old grandfather was walking along, little suspecting what was coming. They both hit him and, coming as they did with such force, they made a deep hole in the earth in which they were almost buried.   That hole is over by Gardnerville. In that hole Indians can always find plenty of wild-grub     wild-wheat, wild potato, wild acorn     plenty there.    Snow very deep.    No   48     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   difference.    Always plenty wild grub there.    I see that hole. I believe that story    THE  ORIGIN  OF  THE DIFFERENT INDIAN  TRIBES   Long, long ago, away over in Paiuti-land there were some young boys and girls playing. They played all sorts of games, but they liked hand-ball best. And as they played, they sang songs of gladness.   There was one old woman, their grandmother, who would not play with them. She had a little baby, her youngest grandchild, whom she was trying to quiet, but the little one cried and cried continuously.   By-and-by the old woman heard a noise outside. She was frightened and called to the young folks.   Some one's coming  You better stop  Better hide  Maybe Evil One, devil, coming      But the young folks paid no attention to her warning. They kept on playing harder than ever. The old woman covered the baby with a big basket and hid her own face in her shawl.   Then the Evil One came in. All the young folks turned to see who was coming in and as soon as they looked upon his face they fell dead. Only the old woman and the baby were left; for the Evil One did not see them.   When he was gone, the old woman snatched up the baby and hurried off down to the river. As she was hurrying along she met an old man.     Where are you going ?   said he. Then the old woman saw that it was the Evil One himself. She was afraid but she did not want him to know it. She kept the baby covered in the basket and answered,   I'm going to the river to get wild potatoes        Where are all the girls?   asked the Evil One.     Oh, they are all over behind the big mountain, playing ball     The Evil One went off to find them, because he thought there were still some left, and the old woman quickly dug a big hole and hid herself and the baby away in it.   When the Evil One found that the old woman had told  him  a lie,  he was very angry.    He came back and   INDIAN LEGENDS OF TAHOE REGION     49   hunted all day long till sundown for her that he might kill her. But he could not find any trace of her. He finally went home and then the old woman took the baby and hid on the top of a big rock, over near where Sheridan now is.   In the morning the Evil One came back to hunt further, but without success.     I guess that the old woman is dead,  said he,   or maybe she's gone across the river.  But the Evil One loses his power if he touches water, so he dare not cross the river to follow her.   The old woman watched him from the top of the rock. Many times she feared lest he should find her, and she covered  the baby more  closely.   At last when he had given up the hunt, she saw him take a great basket and set it down in the road. Into this basket he put great bunches of elderberry roots, and as he put each bunch in, he gave it a name     Washoe, Digger, Paiuti, and so on. Then he put the lid on tightly and went off through the forest.   The old woman watched till the Evil One had gone. Creeping quietly down, she came with the child     she was a little girl now, not a wee baby any more     and sat down near the basket.   Presently there was a murmuring in the basket.   Oh, grandmother, what's that noise ?   said the little girl.     Never mind,  said the grandmother,   don't you touch the basket     But the little girl kept teasing,   Oh, grandmother, what's in there?    And the old woman would say,   Don't you touch it      The old woman turned her back just one minute and the little girl slipped up and raised the lid ever so little. There was a great whirring noise; the lid flew off and out came all the Indians. Off through the air they flew     Washoes to Washoe land; Diggers to Digger land; Paiutis to Nevada     each Indian to his own home.   The story given above is the one told by Jackson, but his wife, Susan, tells the same story with these essential differences.    In her narrative there is no Evil One.   The old   50     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   woman scolded the young people for playing, but they are not all killed. It is the old woman herself who took a Paiuti water-bottle and after filling it with water, took wild seeds and placed them in the bottle, naming them the different Indian tribes. The seeds swelled in the water until they were as big as eggs and out of these the Indians hatched like chickens, and began to fight. It is the noise of the fighting that the baby hears.   As in Jackson's story the baby lets them out, but it is the wind that carries them off to their various homes.   HOW THE  INDIANS  FIRST  GOT  FIRE   The Indians were having a   big time   in a great log cabin. All the birds were there too, for in those days the Indians, birds, and animals could talk to each other.   They were dancing all around the room and all were merry as could be. They had a huge wooden drum and, as they passed this, the dancers kicked it to make music.   Now, among the birds who were there was a big blue-jay. He was a very saucy fellow, just full of mean tricks. When he came to the drum, he kicked it so hard that he broke it all to pieces. Of course this caused a great commotion. Every one was so provoked by his rudeness that they threw him out of the door.   It was raining hard and the impudence was soon washed out of Mr. Blue-Jay. He begged at the door in vain, and at last he huddled up on the branch of a tree, thinking himself greatly abused.   As he sat there, suddenly, far off, he saw a strange light. Now the Blue-Jay has an infinite amount of curiosity, so away he flew to investigate, quite forgetting his troubles.   It was fire which the Indian god had brought down to earth. The Jay got a piece and soon came flying back to the great cabin where the dance was still going on.   When he called now at the door, saying that he had something wonderful to show them, they knew that he was telling the truth. They let him come in, crowding about him to see this wonderful thing.    They did not know what   INDIAN LEGENDS OF TAHOE REGION     51   to make of this strange new thing. Lest anything should happen to it, they dug a hole and buried the fire most carefully.   Tired out with the night's dancing the Indians all went off to rest, leaving the birds to watch the precious fire. But the birds were tired too, and it was not long before they were fast asleep. All except the owl. He was wide awake and he, being very wise, knew that the fire must be put in a safer place. He went out and calling the yellow snake, the rat, and the little   hummer   bird, he explained what he wanted them to do. The snake was to worm his way in under the logs and wait there till the hummer-bird brought him the fire. The rat was to go in and chew all the birds' wings so that they should not be able to catch the little hummer. They were all so fast asleep that the rat was able to do this very easily.   All went just as they planned. The snake took the fire and hid a little spark of it in every buckeye tree. And there the Indians found it when they needed it. For rubbing a piece of cedar and buckeye together, they very quickly make the spark, and produce fire.   A LEGEND OF LAKE TAHOE   The following legend was published some years ago in Sunset Magazine. It was written by Miss Nonette V. Mc-Glashan, who heard it from a Washoe squaw. The story was told with strange gestures and weird pathos:   The ong was a big bird, bigger than the houses of the white man. Its body was like the eagle's, and its wings were longer than the tallest pines. Its face was that of an Indian, but covered with hard scales, and its feet were webbed. Its nest was deep down in the bottom of the Lake, out in the center, and out of the nest rushed all the waters which fill the Lake. There are no rivers to feed the Lake, only the waters from the ong's nest. All the waters flow back near the bottom, in great under-currents, and after passing through the meshes of the nest are sent forth again. Every plant and bird and animal that gets into these under-currents, and sometimes the great trout that are swept into the net-   52     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   like nest are there held fast to furnish food for the ong.   He ate everything, he liked everything, but best of all he liked the taste of human flesh. No one ever heard or saw anything of such poor mortals as were drowned in these waters, for their bodies were carried to the ong's nest and no morsel ever escaped him. Sometimes he would fly about the shores in quest of some child or woman or hunter, yet he was a great coward and was never known to attack any one in camp, or when two or more were together. No arrow could pierce his feathers, nor could the strongest spear do more than glance from the scales on his face and legs, yet his coward's heart made him afraid for his toes had no claws, and his mouth no beak.   Late one fall, the Washoes were making their final hunt before going to the valleys and leaving the Lake locked in its winter snows. The chief's daughter was sixteen years old, and before leaving the Lake he must select the greatest hero in the tribe for her husband, for such had been the custom of the Washoe chiefs ever since the tribe came out of the Northland. Fairer than ever maiden had been was this daughter, and every unmarried brave and warrior in the tribe wished that he had performed deeds of greater prowess, that he might be certain of winning the prize. That last night at the Lake, around the big council fire, each was to recount to the chief the noblest achievement of his life, and when all were heard the chief would choose, and the women join the circle and the wedding take place. For many years the warriors had looked forward to this event, and the tribe had become famed because of acts of reckless daring performed by those who hoped to wed the chief's daughter.   It was the morning of the final day and much game and great stores of dried trout were packed ready for the journey. All were preparing for the wedding festivities, and the fact that no one knew who would be the bridegroom, among all that band of warriors, lent intensest excitement to the event. All were joyous and happy except the maiden and the handsome young brave to whom she had given her heart. In spite of custom or tradition her love had long since gone out to one whose feet had been too young to press the war-path when last the tribe gave battle to their hereditary foes, the   INDIAN LEGENDS OF TAHOE REGION     53   Paiutis. He never had done deed of valor, nor could he even claim the right to sit with the warriors around the council fire. All day long he had been sitting alone on the jutting cliffs which overhang the water, far away from the laughter and shouts of the camp, eagerly, prayerfully watching the great Lake. Surely the Great Spirit would hear his prayer, yet he had been here for days and weeks in unavailing prayer and waiting.   The afternoon was well-nigh spent and the heart of the young brave had grown cold as stone. In his bitter despair he sprang to his feet to defy the Great Spirit in whom he had trusted, but ere he could utter the words his very soul stood still for joy. Slowly rising from the center of the Lake, he saw the ong. Circling high in the heavens, the monster swept now here, now there, in search of prey. The young brave stood erect and waited. When the ong was nearest he moved about slightly to attract its notice. He had not long to wait. With a mighty swoop, the bird dashed to earth, and as it arose, the young brave was seen to be clasped fast in its talons. A great cry of horror arose from the camp, but it was the sweetest note the young brave had ever heard. The bird flew straight up into the sky until Lake and forest and mountains seemed small and dim. When it reached a great height it would drop its prey into the Lake and let the current draw it to its nest. Such was its custom, and for this the brave had prepared by unwinding from his waist a long buckskin cord and tying himself firmly to the ong's leg. The clumsy feet could not grasp him so tightly as to prevent his movements. At last the great feet opened wide, but the Indian did not fall. In a mighty rage, the ong tried in vain to grasp him in his teeth, but the strong web between the bird's toes sheltered him. Again and again the bird tried to use his horrid teeth, and each time his huge body   would fall through the air in such twistings and contortions that those who watched below stared in bewilderment. But what the watchers could not see was that every time the huge mouth opened to snap him, the young brave hurled a handful of poisoned arrowheads into the mouth and down the big throat, their sharp points cutting deep into the unprotected  flesh.    The bird   54     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   tried to dislodge him by rubbing his feet together, but the thong held firm. Now it plunged headlong into the Lake, but its feet were so tied that it could not swim, and though it lashed the waters into foam with its great wings, and though the man was nearly drowned and wholly exhausted, the poison caused the frightened bird such agony that it suddenly arose and tried to escape by flying toward the center of the Lake. The contest had lasted long and the darkness crept over the Lake, and into the darkness the bird vanished.   The women had been long in their huts ere the council fire was kindled and the warriors gravely seated themselves in its circle. No such trifling event as the loss of a young brave could be allowed to interfere with so important an event, and from most of their minds he had vanished. It was not so very unusual for the ong to claim a victim, and, besides, the youth had been warned by his elders that he should not go hunting alone as had been his habit of late.   But while the warriors were working themselves up into a fine frenzy of eloquence in trying to remind the old chief of their bygone deeds of daring, an Indian maiden was paddling a canoe swiftly and silently toward the middle of the Lake. Nona, the chief's daughter understood no more than the rest why her lover had not been dropped into the Lake, nor why the ong had acted so queerly, but she knew that she could die with her lover. She took her own frail canoe because it was so light and easy to row, though it was made for her when a girl, and would scarcely support her weight now. It mattered nothing to her if the water splashed over the sides; it mattered nothing how she reached her lover. She kept saying his name over softly to herself,  Tahoe  My darling Tahoe     When the council was finished, the women went to her hut to bid her come and hear the decision her father was about to render. The consternation caused by her disappearance lasted until the rosy dawn tinged the Washoe peaks and disclosed to the astounded tribe the body of the ong floating on the waters above its nest, and beside it an empty canoe. In the foreground, and gently approaching the shore was the strangest craft that ever floated on water     It was   INDIAN LEGENDS OF TAHOE REGION     55   one of the great ong's wings, and the sail was the tip of the other wing  Standing upon it, clasped in each other's arms, were the young brave, Tahoe, and the daughter of the chief. In the shouts of the tribe, shouts in which warriors and women and children mingled their voices with that of the chief, Tahoe was proclaimed the hero of heroes  The decision was rendered, but the ong's nest remains, and the drowned never rise in Lake Tahoe.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER V   THE VARIOUS  NAMES  OF  LAKE  TAHOE   WE have already seen that Fremont, the discoverer of Lake Tahoe, first called it Lake Bonpland, after   Humboldt's   scientific   co-traveler.    That name, however, never came in general use.    When the great westward emigration began it seemed naturally to be called by its Indian name, Tahoe.   In Innocents Abroad Mark Twain thus petulantly and humorously expresses his dislike of the name, Tahoe, and sarcastically defines its meaning.     Sorrow and misfortune overtake the legislature that still from year to year permits Tahoe to retain its unmusical cognomen  Tahoe  It suggests no crystal waters, no picturesque shores, no sublimity. Tahoe for a sea in the clouds; a sea that has character, and asserts it in solemn calms, at times, at times in savage storms; a sea, whose royal seclusion is guarded by a cordon of sentinel peaks that lift their frosty fronts nine thousand feet above the level world; a sea whose every aspect is impressive, whose belongings are all beautiful, whose lonely majesty types the Deity     Tahoe means grasshoppers. It means grasshopper soup. It is Indian, and suggestive of Indians. They say it is Pi-ute     possibly it is Digger. I am satisfied it was named by the Diggers     those degraded savages who roast their dead relatives, then mix the human grease and ashes of bones with tar, and ' gaum' it thick all over their heads and foreheads and ears, and go caterwauling about the hills and call it mourning. These are the gentry that named the Lake.     People say that Tahoe means ' Silver Lake'   ' Limpid Water'    ' Falling Leaf.' Bosh  It means grasshopper soup, the favorite dish of the Digger tribe     and of the Pi-utes as well. It isn't worth while, in these practical times, for people to talk about Indian poetry     there never was any in them     except in the Feni-more Cooper Indians. But they are an extinct tribe that never existed. I know the Noble Red Man. I have camped with the Indians; I have been on the warpath with them, taken part in the chase with them     for grasshoppers;  helped them steal cattle;  I   56   THE VARIOUS NAMES OF LAKE TAHOE     57   have roamed with them, scalped them, had them for breakfast.   I would gladly eat the whole race if I had a chance.   But I am growing unreliable.    With all due deference to the wisdom     as well as the humor     of Mark Twain as applied to Lake Tahoe, I emphatically disagree with him as to the Indians of the Tahoe region, and also as to the name of the Lake. Tahoe is quite as good-sounding a name as Como, Lucerne, Katrine or Lomond. A name, so long as it is euphonious, is pleasing or not, more because of its associations than anything else. The genuine Indian, as he was prior to the coming of the white man, was uncorrupted, uncivilized, unvitiated, unde-moralized, undiseased in body, mind and soul, a nature-observer, nature-lover and nature-worshiper. He was full of poetic conceptions and fired with a vivid imagination that created stories to account for the existence of unusual, peculiar or exceptional natural objects, that, in brilliancy of conception, daring invention, striking ingenuity and vigor of detail surpass, or at least equal, the best imaginative work of Kipling or Mark Twain himself. It seems to me that his     the Indian's     name for this Lake     Tahoe     is both euphonious and full of poetic and scientific suggestion. It is poetic in that it expresses in a word the unequaled height and purity of so large a body of water, and scientific in that it is truthful and accurate.   But Fremont, the discoverer, evidently did not ask or seek to know its Indian name. As stated elsewhere he erroneously conceived it to be the headquarters of one of the forks of the American river, flowing into the Sacramento, and he so depicts it on his map, giving to it the two names   Mountain Lake   or   Lake Bonpknd.  But neither of these names was acceptable and they practically dropped out of sight.   When the first actual determination of Tahoe's outlet through the Truckee River was made is not definitely known,   58     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   but its approximate location was well enough established in 1853 to enable the official map-maker of the new State of California to depict it with reasonable accuracy, and, for some reason, to name it Lake Bigler, after John Bigler, the third Governor of California.   Citizens are still living both in Nevada and California who well remember when the Lake held this name, and the majority of people undoubtedly used it until 1862. Officially, also, it was known as Lake Bigler in 1862, for in the Nevada Statutes there is recorded an Act approved December 19, 1862, authorizing certain parties to construct a railroad   to be known as the Lake Bigler and Virginia Railroad Co., to commence at a point on the Kingsbury-McDonald road known as the Kingsbury and McDonald Toll House, thence along the southern and eastern shores of Lake Bigler, and in most direct practical route, to the divide between Virginia City and Washoe Valley on east side Washoe Lake, over and through the most practical pass to Virginia City,  and a further right to construct branch road from Virginia to Carson City, Nevada.   In 1861, however, while Downey was Governor of California (he having been elected Lieut. Governor, and taking the office on the resignation of Governor Latham in January i860), an attempt was made to change the name from Bigler to the fanciful one of Tula Tulia, but fortunately it failed and the old name remained in general use.   But in 1862 another effort was made in an entirely different direction and this time with success. It was brought about through the work of William Henry Knight, still living in Los Angeles, who has kindly furnished the following account:   In the year 1859 I was the youngest member of an overland company which crossed the plains and mountains from St. Joseph, Mo., to California.   Our train was in   THE VARIOUS NAMES OF LAKE TAHOE     59   three divisions and consisted of about twenty persons, and forty  horses  and  mules.   One morning in the middle of August we left our camp at the eastern base of the double summit of the Sierra Nevadas and began our ascent. Mounted on my faithful steed, Old Pete, I pushed on in advance of the caravan, in order to get the first view of the already famous mountain lake, then known as Lake Bigler. The road wound through the defile and around the southern border of the Lake on the margin of which we camped for two days.   As I approached the summit I turned from the main road and followed a trail to the right which led to the top of a bare rock overlooking the valley beyond and furnishing an unobstructed view.   Thus my first view of that beautiful sheet of water was from a projecting cliff 1000 feet above its surface, and it embraced not only the entire outline of the Lake with its charming bays and rocky headlands but also the magnificent forests of giant pines and firs in which it was embosomed, and the dozen or more lofty mountain peaks thrusting their white summits into the sky at altitudes varying from 8000 to 11,000 feet above sea level.   The view was, indeed, the most wonderful combination of towering mountains, widespreading valley, gleaming lakes, umbrageous forests, rugged buttresses of granite, flashing streams, tumbling waterfalls, and overarching sky of deepest cerulean hue     all blended into one perfect mosaic of the beautiful, the picturesque, and the majestic, that mortal eye ever rested upon.   No imagination can conceive the beauty, sublimity and inspiration of that scene, especially to one who had for weary months been traversing dusty, treeless and barren plains. The contrast was overwhelming. Tears filled my eyes as I gazed upon the fairy scene. I recall the entrancing picture to-day, in all its splendid detail, so vividly was it photographed upon my brain.   Since that hour I have crossed the continent ten times, over various railway routes, visited most of the States of the Union, and seven foreign countries, heard the testimony of others whose travels have been world-wide, and I doubt if   60     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   another scene of equal enchantment exists on the face of the globe.   In 1861, two years after my visit to Tahoe, I gathered the data for compiling the first general map of the Pacific States, which embraced the region from British Columbia to Mexico, and from the Rocky Mountains to the coast. It was ready for the engraver in February, 1862. I had instructed the draughtsman, V. Wackenreuder, afterward connected with the State Geological Survey, to omit the name of Lake Bigler, which was on contemporary maps.   I invited John S. Hittell, editor of the Aha California, a leading San Francisco daily, and Dr. Henry DeGroot, writer on the Evening Bulletin and correspondent of the able Sacramento Union, to come round to Bancroft's publishing house and inspect the map.   Dr. DeGroot had just returned from a visit to the Corn-stock silver mines in the Washoe district of Western Nevada. He suddenly turned to me and said:   Why, Knight, you have left off the name of Lake Bigler.  I remarked that many people had expressed dissatisfaction with that name, bestowed in honor of a Governor of California who had not distinguished himself by any signal achievement, and I thought that now would be a good time to select an appropriate name and fix it forever on that beautiful sheet of water.   The suggestion met with favor, and several names were proposed     Washington, Lincoln, then war President, Fremont, an early explorer, and other historic names. I asked Dr. DeGroot if he knew what the native Indians called the Lake.   He drew a memorandum from his pocket and read over a list of Indian names local to that region, and exclaimed:   Here it is; they call it ' Tahoe,' meaning ' big water,' or ' high water,' or ' water in a high place.' The word rhymes with Washoe.   I did not quite like the name at first mention, but its significance was so striking that I asked if they     Hittell and DeGroot     would favor its adoption and back it up with the support of their newspapers, and they agreed to do so.   They advocated the adoption of the new name in their   THE VARIOUS NAMES OF LAKE TAHOE     61   respective journals, the country papers almost unanimously fell into line, I inserted it on the map which bore my name     William Henry Knight     as compiler, and which was published by the Bancroft house in 1862.   I immediately wrote to the Land Office at Washington, reported what I had done, and the sentiment that prevailed in California, and requested the Federal official to substitute the name of Tahoe for Bigler on the next annual map to be issued by his office, and in all the printed matter of the Department of the Interior thereafter.    This was done.   But a curious thing happened. Nevada was under a territorial government appointed by the Democratic administration of President Buchanan. The Territorial Legislature was in session when the subject was agitated by the California newspapers. A young statesman of that body, thirsting for fame, rose to his feet and in vociferous tones and with frenzied gestures, denounced this high-handed action of California in changing the name of that Lake without consulting the sister commonwealth of Nevada, as, according to the map, half of that noble sheet of water was in Nevada, and such action would require joint jurisdiction. But his impassioned words were wasted on the desert air of the Sagebrush State. He could not muster enough votes to enact his indignation into a law, and the calm surface of Lake Tahoe was unruffled by the tempestuous commotion raging in legislative halls at Carson City.   It was thus that the beautiful, euphonious, and significant name of   Tahoe   was first placed on my own map, and subsequently appeared on all other maps of the State, because it was universally accepted as a fitting substitute for the former name of   Bigler.  A traveled writer refers to the Lake and the name selected in these terms:     Thus it was that we went to Lake Tahoe, the beautiful ' Big Water' of the Washoe Indians     Tahoe with the indigo shade of its waters emphasized by its snow-capped setting. The very first glance lifts one's soul above the petty cares of the lower valleys, and one feels the significance of the Indian title    ' Big Water '    not referring to size alone, but to the greatness of influence, just as the all-pervading Power is the ' Big Spirit.'        6a     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   One would naturally think that there had been changes enough. But no  In spite of the fact that the Federal government had accepted the change to Tahoe, and that the popular usage had signified the general approval of the name, the Hon. W. A. King, of Nevada County, during the Governorship of Haight, in California, introduced into the assembly a bill declaring that Lake Bigler should be   the official name of the said lake and the only name to be regarded as legal in official documents, deeds, conveyances, leases and other instruments of writing to be placed on state or county records, or used in reports made by state, county or municipal officers.    Historian Hittell thus comments on this:  The bill, which appears to have been well modulated to the taste and feelings of the legislature, went through with great success. It passed the Assembly on February i, the Senate on February 7; and on February 10 it was approved by the Governor. It remains a monument, if not to Bigler, at least to the legislature that passed it; while the name of the Lake will doubtless continue to be Tahoe and its sometime former designation of Bigler be forgotten.    Now if Mark Twain really objected to the name Tahoe why did he not join the Biglerites and insist upon the preservation of that name?   On the Centennial Map of 1876 it was named   Lake Bigler or Lake Tahoe,  showing that some one evidently was aware that, officially, it was still Lake Bigler.   And so, in fact, it is to this date, as far as official action can make it so, and it is interesting to conjecture what the results might be were some malicious person, or some   legal-minded stickler for rigid adherence to the law,  to bring suit against those whose deeds, titles, leases, or other documents declare it to be Lake Tahoe.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER VI   JOHN LE CONTE'S PHYSICAL STUDIES OF LAKE TAHOE   IN certain numbers (November and December 1883 and January  1884)   of the Overland Monthly, Professor John  Le  Conte,   of  the  State  University,   Berkeley, California, presented the results of his physical studies of Lake Tahoe in three elaborate chapters.    From these the following quotations of general interest are taken:   Hundreds of Alpine lakes of various sizes, with their clear, deep, cold, emerald or azure waters, are embosomed among the crags of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The most extensive, as well as the most celebrated, of these bodies of fresh water is Lake Tahoe.   This Lake, . . . occupies an elevated valley at a point where the Sierra Nevada divides into two ranges. It is, as it were, ingulfed between two lofty and nearly parallel ridges, one lying to the east and the other to the west. As the crest of the principal range of the Sierra runs near the western margin of this Lake, this valley is thrown on the eastern slope of this great mountain system.   The boundary line between the States of California and Nevada makes an angle of about 131 degrees in this Lake, near its southern extremity, precisely at the intersection of the 39th parallel of north latitude with the 120th meridian west from Greenwich. Inasmuch as, north of this angle, this boundary line follows the 120th meridian, which traverses the Lake longitudinally from two to four miles from its eastern shore-line, it follows that more than two-thirds of its area falls within the jurisdiction of California, the remaining third being within the boundary of Nevada. It is only within a comparatively recent period that the geographical coordinates of this Lake have been accurately determined.   Its greatest dimension deviates but slightly from a medium   63   64     THE LAKE OF THE SKY     LAKE TAHOE   line. Its maximum length is about 21.6 miles, and its greatest width is about 12 miles. In consequence of the irregularity of its outline, it is difficult to estimate its exact area; but it cannot deviate much from 192 to 195 square miles.   The railroad surveys indicate that the elevation of the surface of its waters above the level of the ocean is about 6247 feet.   Its drainage basin, including in this its own area, is estimated to be about five hundred square miles. Probably more than a hundred affluents of various capacities, deriving their waters from the amphitheater of snow-clad mountains which rise on all sides from 3000 to 4000 feet above its surface, contribute their quota to supply this Lake. The largest of these affluents is the Upper Truckee River, which falls into its southern extremity.   The only outlet to the Lake is the Truckee River, which carries the surplus waters from a point on its northwestern shore out through a magnificent mountain gorge, thence northeast, through the arid plains of Nevada, into Pyramid Lake. This river in its tortuous course runs a distance of over one hundred miles, and for about seventy miles (from Truckee to Wadsworth) the Central Pacific Railroad follows its windings. According to the railroad surveys, this river makes the following descent:                           pa    Distance         Fall       per Mile   Lake Tahoe to Truckee    15 Miles     401 Ft.    28.64 Ft.

Furnished with a good sounding-line and a self-registering thermometer, he was enabled to secure some interesting and trustworthy physical results.   (1.) Depth. It is well known that considerable diversity of opinion has prevailed in relation to the actual depth of Lake Tahoe. Sensational newsmongers have unhesitatingly asserted that, in some portions, it is absolutely fathomless. It is needless to say that actual soundings served to dispel or to rectify this popular impression. The soundings indicated that there is a deep subaqueous channel traversing the whole Lake in its greatest dimension, or south and north. Beginning at the southern end, near the Lake House, and advancing along the long axis of the Lake directly north towards the Hot Springs at the northern end     a distance of about eighteen miles     we have the following depths:   Station                     Depth in Feet    Depth in Meters   1  ...............  90O        274.32   2     ...............   1385                    422.14   3     ...............   1495                    455-67   4    ...............   1500                    457-19   5     ...............   1506                    459-O2   as far as we know, been accurately determined. Henry Gannet, in his Lists of Elevation (4th ed., Washington, 1877, p. 143), gives its altitude above the sea as 4890 feet; and credits this number to the Pacific Railroad Reports. But as this exact number appears in Fremont's Report of Exploring Expedition to Oregon and North California in the Years 1843-44. (Doc. No. 166, p. 217), it is probable that the first rude and necessarily imperfect estimate has been copied by subsequent authorities. This number is evidently more than 800 feet too great; for the railroad station at Wadsworth (about eighteen or twenty miles from the lake), where the line of the railroad leaves the banks of the Truckee River, is only 4077 feet above the sea-level. So that these numbers would make Pyramid Lake 813 feet above the level of its affluent at Wadsworth; which, of course, is impossible. Under this state of facts, I have assumed the elevation of this lake to be 3890 feet.   66     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Station                     Depth in Feet   Depth in Meters   6    ...............   1540                  469.38   7    ...............   1504                  458.41   8    ...............   1600                  487.67   9    ...............   1640                  499.86   10    ...............   1645                  501.39   These figures show that this lake exceeds in depth the deepest of the Swiss lakes (the Lake of Geneva), which has a maximum depth of 334 meters. On the Italian side of the Alps, however, Lakes Maggiore and Como are said to have depths respectively of 796.43 and 586.73 meters. These two lakes are so little elevated above the sea that their bottoms are depressed 587 and 374 meters below the level of the Mediterranean.   (2.) Relation of Temperature to Depth. By means of a self-registering thermometer (Six's) secured to the sounding-line, a great number of observations were made on the temperature of the water of the Lake at various depths and in different portions of the same. These experiments were executed between the nth and 18th of August, 1873. The same general results were obtained in all parts of the Lake. The following table contains the abstract of the average results, after correcting the thermometric indications by comparison with a standard thermometer:   Depth                 Depth       Temp, in    Temp.

This constant temperature which prevails at all depths below say 250 meters is about 4 degrees Cent. (39.2 Fah.). This is precisely what might have been expected; for it is a well established physical property of fresh water, that it attains its maximum density at the above-indicated temperature. In other words, a mass of fresh water at the temperature of 4 deg. Cent, has a greater weight under a given volume (that is, a cubic unit of it is heavier at this temperature) than it is at any temperature either higher or lower. Hence, when the ice-cold water of the snow-fed streams of spring and summer reaches the Lake, it naturally tends to sink as soon as its temperature rises to 4 deg. Cent.; and, conversely, when winter sets in, as soon as the summer-heated surface water is cooled to 4 deg., it tends to sink. Any further rise of temperature of the surface water during the warm season, or fall of temperature during the cold season, alike produces expansion, and thus causes it to float on the heavier water below; so that water at 4 deg. Cent., perpetually remains at the bottom, while the varying temperature of the seasons and the penetration of the solar heat only influence a surface stratum of about 250 meters in thickness. It is evident that the continual outflow of water from its shallow outlet cannot disturb the mass of liquid occupying the deeper portions of the Lake. It thus results that the temperature of the surface stratum of such bodies of fresh water for a certain depth fluctuates with the climate and with the seasons; but at the bottom of deep lakes it undergoes little or no change throughout the year, and approaches to that which corresponds to the maximum density of fresh water.   (3.) Why the Water does not freeze in Winter. Residents on the shore of Lake Tahoe testify that, with the exception of shallow and detached portions, the water of the Lake never freezes in the coldest winters. During the winter months, the temperature of atmosphere about this Lake must fall as low, probably, as o degrees Fah. (   17.78 deg. Cent.). According to the observations of Dr. George M. Bourne, the   68     THE LAKE OF THE SKY     LAKE TAHOE   minimum temperature recorded during the winter of 1873-74 was 6 deg. Fah. (-14.44 deg. Cent.). As it is evident that during the winter season the temperature of the air must frequently remain for days, and perhaps weeks, far below the freezing point of water, the fact that the water of the Lake does not congeal has been regarded as an anomalous phenomenon. Some persons imagine that this may be due to the existence of subaqueous hot springs in the bed of the Lake     an opinion which may seem to be fortified by the fact that hot springs do occur at the northern extremity of the Lake. But there is no evidence that the temperature of any considerable body of water in the Lake 'is sensibly increased by such springs. Even in the immediate vicinity of the hot springs (which have in summer a maximum temperature of 55 deg. C. or 131 F.), the supply of warm water is so limited that it exercises no appreciable influence on the temperature of that portion of the Lake. This is further corroborated by the fact that no local fogs hang over this or any other portion of the Lake during the winter which would most certainly be the case if any considerable body of hot water found its way into the Lake.   The true explanation of the phenomenon may, doubtless, be found in the high specific heat of water, the great depth of the Lake, and in the agitation of its waters by the strong winds of winter. In relation to the influence of depth, it is sufficient to remark that, before the conditions preceding congelation can obtain, the whole mass of water     embracing a stratum of 250 meters in thickness     must be cooled down to 4 deg. Cent.; for this must occur before the vertical circulation is arrested and the colder water floats on the surface. In consequence of the great specific heat of water, to cool such a mass of the liquid through an average temperature of 8 deg. Cent, requires a long time, and the cold weather is over before it is accomplished. In the shallower portions, the surface of the water may reach the temperature of congelation, but the agitations due to the action of strong winds soon breaks up the thin pellicle of ice, which is quickly melted by the heat generated by the mechanical action of the waves. Nevertheless, in shallow and detached portions of the Lake, which are sheltered from the action of winds and waves       CLOUDS OVER THE  MOUNTAINS, LAKE TAHOE   LILY LAKE   CAVE ROCK, LAKE TAHOE   PHYSICAL STUDIES OF LAKE TAHOE     69   as in Emerald Bay     ice several inches in thickness is sometimes formed.   (4.) Why Bodies of the Drowned do not Rise. A number of persons have been drowned in Lake Tahoe     some fourteen between i860 and 1874     and it is the uniform testimony of the residents, that in no case, where the accident occurred in deep water, were the bodies ever recovered. This striking fact has caused wonder-seekers to propound the most extraordinary theories to account for it. Thus one of them says,   The water of the Lake is purity itself, but on account of the highly rarified state of the air it is not very buoyant, and swimmers find some little fatigue; or, in other words, they are compelled to keep swimming all the time they are in the water; and objects which float easily in other water sink here like lead.  Again he says,   Not a thing ever floats on the surface of this Lake, save and except the boats which ply upon it.    It is scarcely necessary to remark that it is impossible that the diminution of atmospheric pressure, due to an elevation of 6250 feet (1905 meters) above the sea-level, could sensibly affect the density of the water. In fact, the coefficient of compressibility of this liquid is so small that the withdrawal of the above indicated amount of pressure (about one-fifth of an atmosphere) would not lower its density more than one hundred-thousandth part  The truth is, that the specific gravity is not lower than that of any other fresh water of equal purity and corresponding temperature. It is not less buoyant nor more difficult to swim in than any other fresh water; and consequently the fact that the bodies of the drowned do not rise to the surface cannot be accounted for by ascribing marvelous properties to its waters.   The distribution of temperature with depth affords a natural and satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon, and renders entirely superfluous any assumption of extraordinary lightness in the water. The true reason why the bodies of the drowned do not rise to the surface is evidently owing to the fact that when they sink into water which is only 4 deg. Cent. (7.2 deg. Fah.) above the freezing temperature, the gases usually generated by decomposition are not produced in the intestines; in other words, at this Jow temperature the   70     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   bodies do not become inflated, and therefore do not rise to the surface. The same phenomenon would doubtless occur in any other body of fresh water under similar physical conditions.1   (5.) Transparency of the Water. All visitors to this beautiful Lake are struck with the extraordinary transparency of the water. At a depth of 15 to 20 meters (49.21 to 65.62 feet), every object on the bottom     on a calm sunny day     is seen with the greatest distinctness. On the 6th of September, 1873, the writer executed a series of experiments with the view of testing the transparency of the water. A number of other experiments were made August 28 and 29, under less favorable conditions. By securing a white object of considerable size     a horizontally adjusted dinner-plate about 9.5 inches in diameter     to the sounding-line, it was ascertained that (at noon) it was plainly visible at a vertical depth of 33 meters, or 108.27 English feet. It must be recollected that the light reaching the eye from such submerged objects must have traversed a thickness of water equal to at least twice the measured depth; in the above case, it must have been at least 66 meters, or 216.54 feet. Furthermore, when it is considered that the amount of light regularly reflected from such a surface as that of a dinner-plate, under large angles of incidence in relation to the surface, is known to be a very small fraction of the incident beam (probably not exceeding three or four per cent.), it is evident that solar light must penetrate to vastly greater depths in these pellucid waters.   Moreover, it is quite certain that if the experiments in relation to the depths corresponding to the limit of visibility of the submerged white disk had been executed in winter instead of summer, much larger numbers would have been obtained. For it is now well ascertained, by means of the researches of Dr. F. A. Forel of Lausanne, that the waters of Alpine lakes are decidedly more transparent in winter than in summer. Indeed, it is reasonable that when the affluents of such lakes are locked in the icy fetters of winter, much   1 It should be noted that since 1874 there have been remarkably few deaths from drowning in Lake Tahoe, and that the major cases of those referred to by Dr. LeConte were of workmen and others who were generally under the influence of intoxicants.   PHYSICAL STUDIES OF LAKE TAHOE     71   less suspended matter is carried into them than in summer, when all the sub-glacial streams are in active operation.   Professor Le Conte goes into this subject (as he later does into the subject of the color of Lake Tahoe) somewhat exhaustively in a purely scientific manner and in too great length for the purposes of this chapter, hence the scientific or curious reader is referred to the original articles for fur-ther information and discussion.   Color of the Waters of Lake Tahoe. One of the most striking features of this charming mountain Lake is the beautiful hues presented by its pellucid waters. On a calm, clear, sunny day, wherever the depth is not less than from fifty to sixty meters, to an observer floating above its surface, the water assumes various shades of blue; from a brilliant Cyan blue (greenish-blue) to the most magnificent ultramarine blue or deep indigo blue. The shades of blue increasing in darkness in the order of the colors of the solar spectrum, are as follows: Cyan-blue (greenish blue), Prussian-blue, Cobalt-blue, genuine ultramarine-blue, and artificial ultramarine-blue (violet blue). While traversing one portion of the Lake in a steamer, a lady endowed with a remarkable natural appreciation and discrimination of shades of color declared that the exact tint of the water at this point was   Marie-Louise blue.    The waters of this Lake exhibit the most brilliant blueness in the deep portions, which are remote from the fouling influences of the sediment-bearing affluents, and the washings of the shores. On a bright and calm day, when viewed in the distance, it had the ultramarine hue; but when looked fair down upon, it was of almost inky blackness     a solid dark blue qualified by a trace of purple or violet. Under these favorable conditions, the appearance presented was not unlike that of the liquid in a vast natural dyeing-vat.   A clouded state of the sky, as was to be expected, produced the well-known effects due to the diminished intensity of light ; the shades of blue became darker, and, in extreme cases, almost black-blue. According to our observations, the obscurations of the sky by the interposition of clouds produced no   72     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   other modifications of tints than those due to a diminution of luminosity.   In places where the depth is comparatively small and the bottom is visibly white, the water assumes various shades of green; from a delicate apple-green to the most exquisite emerald-green. Near the southern and western shores of the Lake, the white, sandy bottom brings out the green tints very strikingly In the charming cul-de-sac called   Emerald Bay,  it is remarkably conspicuous and exquisitely beautiful. In places where the stratum of water covering white portions of the bottom is only a few meters in thickness, the green hue is not perceptible, unless viewed from such a distance that the rays of light emitted obliquely from the white surface have traversed a considerable thickness of the liquid before reaching the eye of the observer.   The experiments with the submerged white dinner-plate, in testing the transparency of the water, incidentally manifested, to some extent, the influence of depth on the color of the water. The white disk presented a bluish-green tint at the depth of from nine to twelve meters; at about fifteen meters it assumed a greenish-blue hue, and the blue element increased in distinctness with augmenting depth, until the disk became invisible or undistinguishable in the surrounding mass of blue waters. The water intervening between the white disk and the observer did not present the brilliant and vivid green tint which characterized that which is seen in the shallow portions of the Lake, where the bottom is white. But this is not surprising, when we consider the small amount of diffused light which can reach the eye from so limited a surface of diffusion.   In studying the chromatic tints of these waters, a hollow pasteboard cylinder, five or six centimeters in diameter, and sixty or seventy centimeters in length, was sometimes employed for the purpose of excluding the surface reflection and the disturbances due to the small ripples on the water. When quietly floating in a small row-boat, one end of this exploring tube was plunged under the water, and the eye of the observer at the other extremity received the rays of light emanating from the deeper portions of the liquid. The light thus reaching the eye presented essentially the same   PHYSICAL STUDIES OF LAKE TAHOE     73   variety of tints in the various portions of the Lake as those which have been previously indicated.   Hence it appears that under various conditions     such as depth, purity, state of sky and color of bottom     the waters of this Lake manifest nearly all the chromatic tints presented in the solar spectrum between greenish-yellow and the darkest ultramarine-blue, bordering upon black-blue.   It is well known that the waters of oceans and seas exhibit similar gradations of chromatic hues in certain regions. Navigators have been struck with the variety and richness of tints presented, in certain portions, by the waters of the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and especially those of the Caribbean Sea. In some regions of the oceans and seas, the green hues, and particularly those tinged with yellow, are observed in comparatively deep waters, or, at least, where the depths are sufficiently great to prevent the bottom from being visible. But this phenomenon seems to require the presence of a considerable amount of suspended matter in the water. In no portion of Lake Tahoe did I observe any of the green tints, except where the light-colored bottom was visible. This was, probably, owing to the circumstance that no considerable quantity of suspended matter existed in any of the waters observed.   Rhythmical Variations of Level in Lakes: or  Seiches.     As might be expected, the waters of Lake Tahoe are subject to fluctuations of level, depending upon the variable supplies furnished by its numerous affluents. In mid-winter, when these streams are bound in icy fetters, the level falls; while in the months of May and June, when the snows of the amphitheater of mountain-slopes are melting most rapidly, the level of the Lake rises, and a maximum amount of water escapes through its outlet. According to the observations of Capt. John McKinney, made at his residence on the western shore of this Lake, the average seasonal fluctuation of level is about 0.61 of a meter; but in extreme seasons it sometimes amounts to 1.37 meters. The Lake of Geneva, in like manner, is liable to fluctuations of level amounting to from 1.95 to 2.60 meters, from the melting of the Alpine snows.   But besides these variations of level due to the variable quantities of water discharged into them by their affluents,   74     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   many lakes of moderate dimensions are liable to rhythmical oscillations of level of short duration, which are, obviously, but produced by fluctuations in the supply of water. It is to this kind of species of variation of level that our attention will be directed in the sequel.   This interesting phenomenon was first recognized in the Lake of Geneva; but was subsequently found to be common to all the Swiss lakes, as well as to those of Scotland. It is, therefore, a general phenomenon, which may be observed in all lakes of moderate dimensions. The inhabitants of the shores of the Lake of Geneva have long designated this rhythmical oscillation of the level of the water by the term of Seiche; and this designation has been adopted by scientific writers.   These Seiches were first signalized in the Lake of Geneva in 1730, by Fatio de Duillier, who ascribed them to the checking of the flow of the waters of the Rhone on the shoal near Geneva by the force of the wind at mid-day. Addison and Jallabert, in 1742, supposed them to be caused by sudden increments in the discharge of the affluents, due to the augmentation in the amount of snow melted after mid-day; or to the sudden increase in the flow of the Arve, checking the outflow of water by the Rhone. Bertrand supposed that electrified clouds might locally attract and elevate the waters of the lake, and thus produce oscillations of level. H. B. de Saussure, in 1799, attributed the phenomenon to rapid local variations of atmospheric pressure on different parts of the lake. J. P. E. Vaucher, in 1802 and 1804, adopted de Saussure's explanation, and confirmed it by many excellent observations. He, moreover, established that Seiches, more or less considerable, occur in all the Swiss lakes; and that they take place at all seasons of the year, and at all times of the day; but, in general, more frequently in spring and autumn. As regards the cause of the phenomenon, Vaucher shows how rapid local alterations of atmospheric pressure would produce oscillations in the level of the lake, and compares them to the vibrations of a liquid in a recurved tube or siphon. Finally, Arago maintained that Seiches may arise from various causes, and traced the analogy between them and certain remarkable oscilla-   PHYSICAL STUDIES OF LAKE TAHOE     75   tions of the sea, including those arising from earthquakes.   But physical science is indebted to Professor F. A. Forel, of Lausanne, for the most complete and exhaustive investigation in relation to the phenomena of Seiches. This accomplished physicist began his researches in 1869, and has continued them up to the present time. He has been able to demonstrate that these rhythmical oscillations occur in nearly all the Swiss Lakes (he studied the phenomena in nine of them), and that they follow in all cases the same general laws. Those of the Lake of Geneva have received the most elaborate and prolonged investigation. In March, 1876, Forel established a self-registering tide-gauge (limni-metre enregistreur) on the northern shore of this lake, at Morges; and, with the cooperation of P. Plantamour, another one was installed in June, 1877, at Secheron, near the city of Geneva, at the southern extremity. Since these dates, these two instruments have, respectively, been registering oscillations of the level of the water of the Lake of Geneva; and they are so sensitive as to indicate the waves generated by a steamer navigating the lake at a distance of ten or fifteen kilometers.   From a most searching investigation of all the phenomena presented by the Seiches in the Swiss Lakes, Forel deduces the conclusion that they are really movements of steady uni-nodal oscillations (balanced undulations), in which the whole mass of water in the lake rhythmically swings from shore to shore. And, moreover, he shows that the water oscillates according to the two principal dimensions of the lake; thus, giving rise to longitudinal Seiches and transverse Seiches. They occur in series of tautochronous oscillations of decreasing amplitude; the first wave produced by the action of a given cause having a maximum amplitude.   Causes. The disturbances of hydrostatic equilibrium which generate Seiches may be produced by a variety of causes. Among these, the following may be cited: (a) Sudden local variations of atmospheric pressure on different parts of the lake, (b) A descending wind, striking the surface of the lake over a limited area, (c) Thunder-storms, hail-storms, and water-spouts; and especially when the accompanying winds act vertically,    (d)  The fall of a large   76     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   avalanche, or of a land-slide into the lake, (e) And lastly, earthquakes.   Observations show that the most frequent and evident of these causes are variations of atmospheric pressure and local storms. With regard to earthquake shocks as a cause of such fluctuations of level, it is a singular and significant fact that since Forel has established the delicate self-registering apparatus on the shores of the Lake of Geneva, no less than twelve earthquake shocks have been experienced in this portion of Switzerland, and they have had no sensible influence on these sensitive instruments. In fact, a little consideration in relation to the character of such shocks renders it highly improbable that such brief tremors of the earth's crust could have been any agency in the generation of rhythmical oscillations of the whole mass of water in the lake. Indeed, it is very questionable whether any earthquake waves are ever produced in the ocean, except when the sea-bottom undergoes a permanent vertical displacement.   Lake Tahoe. From inquiries made of the inhabitants of the shores of Lake Tahoe, I was not able to discover that any rhythmical oscillations of the level of its waters have ever been noticed. Some residents declared that they had observed sudden fluctuations of level, which, from their suddenness, they were disposed to ascribe to disturbances of the bottom of the Lake due to volcanic agencies, although they were unable to coordinate such oscillations with any earthquake manifestations on the adjacent shores.   It is evident, however, that until arrangements are consummated for recording systematic observations on the variations of the level of this Lake, we cannot expect that its Seiches will be detected. Of course, self-registering gauges would give the most satisfactory results; but any graduated gauge, systematically observed, would soon furnish evidence of the phenomenon. For the longitudinal Seiches,   Hot Springs,  at the northern extremity of the Lake, or   Lake House,  at the southern end, would be eligible stations for gauges; and for the transverse Seiches, Glenbrook, on the eastern shore, or Capt. McKinney's on the western margin, would afford good stations.   PHYSICAL STUDIES OF LAKE TAHOE     77   As far as I am aware, true Seiches have never been observed in any of the American lakes. This fact is the more remarkable from the circumstance that long-continued and careful observations have been made on the fluctuations of level of several of the large Canadian lakes, with the view of testing the possible existence of lunar tides. Perhaps these lakes may be too large to manifest the uninodal rhythmical oscillations which have been so successfully studied by Forel in the smaller lakes of Switzerland.1   Be this as it may, there can be no doubt that Lake Tahoe is a body of water in all respects adapted for the manifestation of this species of oscillation; and that, like the Swiss lakes, it is subject to Seiches. Indeed, the far greater simplicity in the configuration of the basin of Lake Tahoe than that of the Lake of Geneva must render the phenomena much less complicated in the former than in the latter.   Professor LeConte then gives his computations as to the probable duration of the oscillations on Lake Tahoe, should they occur there.   1 It is proper to add that Fluctuations of level in the North American lakes have been noticed by various observers, from the time of the Jesuit Fathers of the period of Marquette, in 1673, down to the present epoch. Among those who have discussed this problem may be mentioned in chronological order: Fra Marquette in 1673, Baron La Hontan 1689, Charlevoix 1721, Carver 1766, Weld 1796, Major S. A. Storrow 1817, Capt. Henry Whiting 1819, H, R. Schoolcraft 1820, Gen. Dearborn 1836-29.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER VII   HOW  LAKE TAHOE  WAS FORMED   LINDGREN, the geologist, affirms that after the Sierra Nevada range was thrust up, high into the heavens, vast and long continued erosion   planed down this range to a surface of comparatively gentle topography.  He claims that it must originally have been of great height. Traces of this eroded range (Cretaceous)   still remain in a number of flat-topped hills and ridges that rise above the later tertiary surface. There is reason to believe that this planed-down mountain range had a symmetrical structure, for somewhat to the east of the present divide is a well-marked old crest line extending from the Grizzly Peak Mountains on the north, in Plumas County, at least as far south as Pyramid Peak, in Eldorado County. At sometime in the later part of the Cretaceous period the first breaks took place, changing the structure of the range from symmetrical to monoclinal and outlining the present form of the Sierra Nevada.    This great disturbance he thinks,   was of a two-fold character, consisting of the lifting up of a large area including at least a part of the present Great Basin  Nevada and Utah  and a simultaneous breaking and settling of the higher portions of the arch. Along the eastern margin a system of fractures was thus outlined which toward the close of the Tertiary was to be still further emphasized. The main break probably extended from a point south of Mono Lake to Ante-   78   HOW LAKE TAHOE WAS FORMED        79   lope Valley and from Markleeville northward toward Sierra Valley. A large part of the crust block to the west of this dislocation also sank down. This sunken area is now indicated by Lake Tahoe and by its northward continuation, Sierra Valley, separated from each other only by masses of Tertiary lavas. ... It is worthy of note that within the area of the range no volcanic eruptions accompanied this subsidence.    He continues:  As a consequence of this uplift the erosive power of the streams was rejuvenated, the Cretaceous surface of gentle outline was dissected, and the rivers began to cut back behind the old divide, carrying their heads nearly to the present crest line that separates the slope of the Sierra from the depression of Lake Tahoe.    These rivers are the great gold bearing streams that caused the mining excitement of 1849. They all head near the Tahoe region, and include the Yuba, Feather, American, Moke-lumne, Calaveras, Cataract, and Tuolumne.   Here, then, were two crest lines     the old Cretaceous line of which the Crystal Range immediately overlooking Desolation Valley on the west, with Pyramid and Agassiz Peaks as its salient points,    and the new Tertiary crest line, reaching somewhat irregularly from Honey Lake in the north to Mono Lake in the south. At the north of Lake Tahoe,   southwest of Reno, a large andesitic volcano poured forth lavas which extend between the Truckee River Canyon and the Washoe Valley. In the region extending northward from Lake Tahoe to Sierra Valley enormous andesitic eruptions took place, and the products of these volcanoes are now piled up as high mountains, among which Mount Pluto nearly attains 9000 feet.    These are the volcanic lavas which united the two crests forming the eastern and western borders of the Tahoe basin or depression, and through which the Truckee River had in   80     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   some way to find passage ere it could discharge its waters into Pyramid Lake, resting in the bosom of the Great Basin.   Here, then, we have the crude Tahoe basin ready for the reception of water. This came from the snow and rainfall on its large and mountainous drainage area, a hundred greater and lesser streams directly and indirectly discharging their flow into its tremendous gulf.   Its later topography has been materially modified by glacial action, and this is fully discussed by Professor Joseph Le Conte in the following chapter.   It should not be forgotten, however, that while Mt. Pluto was being formed, other vast volcanic outpourings were taking place. Well back to the west of the Tahoe region great volcanoes poured out rhyolite, a massive rock of light gray to pink color and of fine grain, which shows small crystals of quartz and sanidine in a streaky and glossy ground mass. On the summits nearer to Tahoe the volcanic outflows were of andesite, a rough and porous rock of dark gray to dark brown color. Lindgren says:   By far the greater part of the andesite occurs in the form of a tuffaceous breccia in numerous superimposed flows. These breccias must have issued from fissures near the summit of the range and were, either before their eruption or at the time of issue, mixed with enormous quantities of water, forming mud flows sufficiently fluid to spread down the slope for distances of fifty or sixty miles. The derivation of the water and the exact mode of eruption are difficult to determine. . . . Towards the summits the breccias gradually lose their stratified character and become more firmly cemented. Over large areas in the Truckee quadrangle the andesite masses consist of breccias containing numerous dykes and necks of massive andesite. . . .     The andesite volcanoes were mainly located along the crest of the Sierra, in fact, almost continuously from Thompson Peak, west of Honey Lake, down to latitude 380 10'.   HOW LAKE TAHOE WAS FORMED       81   Farther south the eruptions diminished greatly in intensity. . . . Along the first summit of the range west of Tahoe the greatest number of vents are found. Beginning at Webber Lake on the north, they include Mount Lola, Castle Peak, Mount Lincoln, Tinker Knob, Mount Mildred and Twin Peak. The andesite masses here in places attain a thickness of 2000 feet. An interval followed in the northern part of the Pyramid Peak quadrangle where no important volcanoes were located, but they appear again in full force in Alpine County. Round Top, attaining an elevation of 10,430 feet, and the adjacent peaks, were the sources of the enormous flows which covered a large part of Eldorado County. Still another volcanic complex with many eruptive vents is that situated in the western part of Alpine County, near Marklee-ville, which culminates in Highland Peak and Raymond Peak, the former almost reaching 11,000 feet. The total thickness of the volcanic flows in this locality is as much as 4000 feet.    It is to these breccias we owe the volcanic appearances in the Truckee River Canyon, a few miles before reaching the Lake. There are several layers of the andesites breccias at the head of Bear Creek Canyon, above Deer Park Springs.     None of the craters,  says Lindgren,   of these volcanoes are preserved, and at the time of their greatest activity they may have reached a height of several thousand feet above the present summits.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER VIII   THE GLACIAL  HISTORY OF LAKE TAHOE   WE have already seen in the preceding chapter how the great basin, in which Lake Tahoe       rests, was turned out in the rough from Nature's workshop. It must now be smoothed down,       its angularities removed, its sharpest features eliminated, and soft and fertile banks       prepared upon which trees, shrubs, plants and flowers might spring forth to give beauty to       an otherwise naked and barren scene.   It is almost impossible for one to picture the Tahoe basin at this time. There may have       been water in it, or there may not. All the great mountain peaks, most of them, perhaps,       much higher by several thousands of feet than at present, were rude, rough, jagged masses,       fresh from the factory of God. There was not a tree, not a shrub, not a flower, not a       blade of grass. No bird sang its cheering song, or delighted the eye with its gorgeous       plumage; not even a frog croaked, a cicada rattled, or a serpent hissed. All was barren       desolation, fearful silence and ghastly newness.   What were the forces that produced so marvelous a change ?   Snowflakes,     flowers of the air,     as John Muir so poetically calls them. They       accomplished the work. Falling alone they could have done nothing, but coming down in vast       numbers, day after day, they piled up and became a power. Snow forms glaciers, and       glaciers are mighty forces that create things.   Let us, if possible, stand and watch the Master Workman   82   GILMORE LAKE, PYRAMID PEAK AND THE CRYSTAL RANGE, IN WINTER, FROM  SUMMIT OF MOUNT TALLAC   DESOLATION VALLEY, LOOKING TOWARD MOSQUITO PASS   HEATHER LAKE, NEAR GLEN ALPINE   SUSIE  LAKE,  NEAR GLEN ALPINE SPRINGS   GLACIAL HISTORY OF LAKE TAHOE     83   doing the work that is to make this region our source of present day joy. We will make the       ascent and stand on the summit of Pyramid Peak. This is now 10,020 feet above sea level,       rising almost sheer above Desolation Valley immediately at our feet.   The first thing that arrests the visitor's attention is the peculiar shape of the peak       upon which he stands, and of the whole of the Crystal Range. Both east and west it is a       great precipice, with a razor-like edge, which seems to have been especially designed for       the purpose of arresting the clouds and snow blown over the mountain ranges of the High       Sierras, and preventing their contents falling upon the waste and thirsty, almost       desert-areas of western Nevada, which lie a few miles further east.   Whence do the rains and snow-storms come ?   One hundred and fifty miles, a trifle more or less, to the westward is the vast bosom of       the Pacific Ocean. Its warm current is constantly kissed by the fervid sun and its water       allured, in the shape of mist and fog, to ascend into the heavens above. Here it is gently       wafted by the steady ocean breezes over the land to the east. In the summer the wind       currents now and again swing the clouds thus formed northward, and Oregon and Washington       receive rain from the operation of the sun upon the Pacific Ocean of the south. In June       and July, however, the Tahoe region sees occasional rains which clear the atmosphere,       freshen the flowers and trees, and give an added charm to everything. But in the fall and       winter the winds send the clouds more directly eastward, and in crossing the Sierran       summits the mist and fog become colder and colder, until, when the clouds are arrested by       the stern barriers of the Crystal Range, and necessity compels them to discharge their       burden, they scatter snow so profusely that one who sees this region only in the summer       has no conception of its winter appearance.   The snow does   84     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   not fall as in ordinary storms, but, in these altitudes, the very heavens seem to press       down, ladened with snow, and it falls in sheets to a depth of five, ten, twenty, thirty       and even more feet, on the level.   Look now, however, at the western edge of the Crystal Range. It has no   slopes.  It is       composed of a series of absolute precipices, on the edge of one of which we stand. These       precipices, and the razor edge, are fortified and buttressed by arms which reach out       westward and form rude crescents, called by the French geologists cirques, for here the       snow lodges, and is packed to great density and solidity with all the force, fervor and       fury of the mountain winds.   But the snow does not fall alone on the western cirques. It discharges with such       prodigality, and the wind demands its release with such precipitancy, that it lodges in       equally vast masses on the eastern slopes of the Crystal Range. For, while the eastern       side of this range is steep enough to be termed in general parlance   precipitous,  it has       a decided slope when compared with the sheer drop of the western side. Here the       configuration and arrangement of the rock-masses also have created a number of cirques,       where remnants of the winter's snow masses are yet to be seen. These snow masses are baby       glaciers, or snow being slowly manufactured into glaciers, or, as some authorities think,       the remnants of the vast glaciers that once covered this whole region with their heavy and       slowly-moving icy cap.   On the Tallac Range the snow fell heavily toward Desolation Valley, but also on the steep       and precipitous slopes that faced the north. So also with the Angora Range. Its western       exposure, however, is of a fairly gentle slope, so that the snow was blown over to the       eastern side, where there are several precipitous cirques of stupendous size for the       preservation of the accumulated and accumulating snow.   Now let us, in imagination, ascend in a balloon over this   GLACIAL HISTORY OF LAKE TAHOE     85   region and hover there, seeking to reconstruct, by mental images, the appearance it must       have assumed and the action that took place in the ages long ago.   Snow, thirty, fifty, one hundred or more feet deep lay, on the level, and on the mountain       slopes or in precipitous cirques twice, thrice, or ten times those depths. Snow thus       packed together soon changes its character. From the light airy flake, it becomes, in       masses, what the geologists term neve. This is a granular snow, intermediate between snow       and ice. A little lower down this neve is converted into true glacial ice-beds, which grow       longer, broader, deeper and thicker as the neve presses down from above.   Lay minds conceive of these great ice-beds of transformed snow as inert, immovable bodies.       They think the snow lies upon the surface of the rocks or earth. The scientific observer       knows better. By the very inertia of its own vast and almost inconceivable weight the       glacier is compelled to move. Imagine the millions of millions of tons of ice of these       sloping masses, pressing down upon the hundreds of thousands of tons of ice that lie       below. Slowly the mass begins to move. But all parts of it do not move with equal       velocity. The center travels quicker than the margins, and the velocity of the surface is       greater than that of the bottom. Naturally the velocity increases with the slope, and when       the ice begins to soften in the summer time its rate of motion is increased.   But not only does the ice move. There have been other forces set in motion as well as that       of the ice. The fierce attacks of the storms, the insidious forces of frost, of expansion       and contraction, of lightning, etc., have shattered and loosened vast masses of the       mountain summits. Some of these have weathered into toppling masses, which required only a       heavy wind or slight contractions to send them from their uncertain bases onto the snow or       ice beneath. And the other causes mentioned all had their influences in breaking up the   86     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   peaks and ridges and depositing great jagged bowlders of rock in the slowly-moving       glaciers.   Little by little these masses of rock worked their way down lower into the ice-bed.       Sometime they must reach the bottom, yet, though they rest upon granite, and granite would       cleave to granite, the irresistible pressure from above forces the ice and rock masses       forward. Thus the sharp-edged blocks of granite become the blades in the tools that are to       help cut out the contours of a world's surface. In other words the mass of glacial ice is       the grooving or smoothing plane, and the granite blocks, aided by the ice, become the many       and diverse blades in this vast and irresistible tool. Some cut deep and square, others       with flutings and bevelings, or curves, but each helps in the great work of planing off,       in some way, the rocky masses over which they move. Hence it will be seen that the       grooving and marking, the fluting and beveling, the planing and smoothing processes of the       ice are materially aided and abetted by the very hardness and weight of the granite and       other rocks it carries with it.   Now let Joseph LeConte take up the theme and give us of the rich treasure-store of his       knowledge and observation. In the American Journal of Science and Arts, Third Series, for       1875, he discussed the very field we are now interested in, and his fascinating and       illuminating explanations render the subject perfectly clear.    Said he:   Last summer I had again an opportunity of examining the pathways of some of the ancient       glaciers of the Sierra. One of the grandest of these is what I call the Lake Valley       Glacier.1 Taking its rise in snow fountains among the high peaks in the neighborhood of       Silver Mountain, this great glacier flowed northward down Lake Valley, and, gathering       tributaries from the summit ridges on either side of the valley   1 This is the name given by Dr. LeConte to the Basin in which Lake Tahoe rests and       including the meadow lands above Tallac.   PYRAMID PEAK AND LAKE OF THE WOODS, NEAR LAKE TAHOE, CALIF.   SNOW BANK, DESOLATION VALLEY, NEAR LAKE TAHOE   GRASS  LAKE, NEAR GLEN  ALPINE SPRINGS   GLACIAL HISTORY OF LAKE TAHOE     87   but especially from the higher western summits, it filled the basin of Lake Tahoe, forming       a great   mer de glace,  50 miles long, 15 miles wide, and at least 2000 feet deep, and       finally escaped northeastward to the plains. The outlets of this great   mer de glace         are yet imperfectly known. A part of the ice certainly escaped by Truckee Canyon *(the       present outlet of the Lake); a part probably went over the northeastern margin of the       basin. My studies during the summer were confined to some of the larger tributaries of       this great glacier.   Truckee Canyan and Donner Lake Glaciers. I have said that one of the outlets of the great         mer de glace   was by the Truckee River Canyon. The stage road to Lake Tahoe runs in       this canyon for fifteen miles. In most parts of the canyon the rocks are volcanic and       crumbling, and therefore ill adapted to retain glacial marks; yet in some places where the       rock is harder these marks are unmistakable. On my way to and from Lake Tahoe, I observed       that the Truckee Canyon glacier was joined at the town of Truckee by a short but powerful       tributary, which, taking its rise in an immense rocky amphitheater surrounding the head of       Donner Lake, flowed eastward. Donner Lake, which occupies the lower portion of this       amphitheater, was evidently formed by the down-flowing of the ice from the steep slopes of       the upper portion near the summit. The stage road from Truckee to the summit runs along       the base of a moraine close by the margin of the lake on one side, while on the other       side, along the apparently almost perpendicular rocky face of the amphitheater, 1000 feet       above the surface of the lake, the Central Pacific Railroad winds its fearful way to the       same place. In the upper portion of this amphitheater large patches of snow still remain       unmelted during the summer.   My examination of these two glaciers, however, was very cursory. I hasten on, therefore,       to others which I traced more carefully.   Lake Tahoe lies countersunk on the very top of the Sierra. This great range is here       divided into two summit ridges, between which lies a trough 50 miles long, 20 miles wide,       and 3000 to 3500 feet deep. This trough is Lake Valley. Its lower half is filled with the       waters of Lake Tahoe.   88     THE LAKE OF THE SKY     LAKE TAHOE   The area of this Lake is about 250 square miles, its depth 1640 feet, and its altitude       6200 feet. It is certain that during the fullness of glacial times this trough was a great         mer de glace,  receiving tributaries from all directions except the north. But as the       Glacial Period waned     as the great   mer de glace   dwindled and melted away, and the       lake basin became occupied by water instead, the tributaries still remained as separate       glaciers flowing into the Lake. The tracks of these lingering small glaciers are far more       easily traced and their records more easily read, than those of the greater but more       ancient glacier of which they were once but the tributaries.   Of the two summit ridges mentioned above the western is the higher. It bears the most snow       now, and in glacial times gave origin to the grandest glaciers. Again: the peaks on both       these summits rise higher and higher as we go toward the upper or southern end of the       Lake. Hence the largest glaciers ran into the Lake at its southwestern end. And, since the       mountain slopes here are toward the northeast and therefore the shadiest and coolest, here       also the glaciers have had the greatest vitality and lived the longest, and have,       therefore, left the plainest records. Doubtless, careful examination would discover the       pathways of glaciers running into the Lake from the eastern summit also; but I failed to       detect any very clear traces of such, either on the eastern or on the northern portion of       the western side of the Lake; while between the southwestern end and Sugar Pine Point, a       distance of only eight or ten miles, I saw distinctly the pathways of five or six. North       of Sugar Pine Point there are also several. They are all marked by moraine ridges running       down from the summits and projecting as points into the Lake. The pathways of three of       these glaciers I studied somewhat carefully, and after a few preliminary remarks, will       describe in some detail.   Mountains are the culminating points of the scenic grandeur and beauty of the earth. They       are so, because they are also the culminating points of all geological agencies     igneous       agencies in mountain formation, aqueous agencies in mountain sculpture. Now, I have       already said that the mountain peaks which stand above the Lake on   GLACIAL HISTORY OF LAKE TAHOE     89   every side are highest at the southwestern end, where they rise to the altitude of 3000       feet above the lake surface, or between 9000 and 10,000 feet above the sea. Here,       therefore, ran in the greatest glaciers; here we find the pro-foundest glacial       sculpturings; and here also are clustered all the finest beauties of this the most       beautiful of mountain lakes. I need only name Mount Tallac, Fallen Leaf Lake, Cascade       Lake, and Emerald Bay, all within three or four miles of each other and of the Tallac       House. These three exquisite little lakes (for Emerald Bay is also almost a lake), nestled       closely against the loftiest peaks of the western summit ridge, are all perfect examples       of glacial lakes.   South of Lake Tahoe, Lake Valley extends for fifteen miles as a plain, gently rising       southward. At its lower end it is but a few feet above the lake surface, covered with       glacial drift modified by water, and diversified, especially on its western side, by       debris ridges, the moraines of glaciers which continued to flow into the valley or into       the Lake long after the main glacier, of which they were once tributaries, had dried up.       On approaching the south end of the Lake by steamer, I had observed these long ridges,       divined their meaning, and determined on a closer acquaintance. While staying at the       Tallac House I repeatedly visited them and explored the canyons down which their materials       were brought.    I proceed to describe them.   Fallen Leaf Lake Glacier. Fallen Leaf Lake lies on the plain of Lake Valley, about one and       a half miles from Lake Tahoe, its surface but a few feet above the level of the latter       Lake x; but its bottom far, probably several hundred feet, below that level. It is about       three to three and one-half miles long and one and one-fourth miles wide. From its upper       end runs a canyon bordered on either side by the highest peaks in this region. The rocky       walls of this canyon terminate on the east side at the head of the lake, but on the west       side, a little farther down. The lake is bordered on each side by an admirably marked       debris ridge (moraine) three hundred feet high, four miles long, and one and one-half to       two miles apart.    These moraines may be   1 Professor Price informs me there is a difference of eighty feet between the level of       Lake Tahoe and Fallen Leaf Lake.      90     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   traced back to the termination of the rocky ridges which bound the canyon. On one side the       moraine lies wholly on the plain; on the other side its upper part lies against the slope       of Mount Tallac. Near the lower end of the lake a somewhat obscure branch ridge comes off       from each main ridge, and curving around it forms an imperfect terminal moraine through       which the outlet of the lake breaks its way.   On ascending the canyon the glaciation is very conspicuous, and becomes more and more       beautiful at every step. From Glen Alpine Springs upward it is the most perfect I have       ever seen. In some places the white rocky bottom of the canyon, for many miles in extent,       is smooth and polished and gently undulating, like the surface of a glassy but billowy       sea. The glaciation is distinct also up the sides of the canyon iooo feet above its floor.   There can be no doubt, therefore, that a glacier once came down this canyon filling it       iooo feet deep, scooped out Fallen Leaf Lake just where it struck the plain and changed       its angle of slope, and pushed its snout four miles out on the level plain, nearly to the       present shores of Lake Tahoe, dropping its debris on either side and thus forming a bed       for itself. In its subsequent retreat it seems to have rested its snout some time at the       lower end of Fallen Leaf Lake, and accumulated there an imperfect terminal moraine.   Cascade Lake Glacier. Cascade Lake, like Fallen Leaf Lake, is about one and one-half miles       from Lake Tahoe, but, unlike Fallen Leaf Lake, its discharge creek has considerable fall,       and the lake surface is, therefore, probably iOO feet above the level of the greater lake.       On either side of this creek, from the very border of Lake Tahoe, runs a moraine ridge up       to the lake, and thence along each side of the lake up to the rocky points which terminate       the true mountain canyon above the head of the lake. I have never anywhere seen more       perfectly defined moraines. I climbed over the larger western moraine and found that it is       partly merged into the eastern moraine of Emerald Bay to form a medial at least 300 feet       high, and of great breadth. From the surface of the little lake the curving branches of       the main moraine, meeting below the lake to form a terminal moraine, are very distinct.         At the head of the lake there   GLACIAL HISTORY OF LAKE TAHOE     91   is a perpendicular cliff over which the river precipitates itself, forming a very pretty       cascade of 100 feet or more. On ascending the canyon above the head of the lake, for       several miles, I found, everywhere, over the lip of the precipice, over the whole floor of       the canyon, and up the sides 1000 feet or more, the most perfect glaciation.   There cannot, therefore, be the slightest doubt that this also is the pathway of a glacier       which once ran into Lake Tahoe. After coming down its steep rocky bed, this glacier       precipitated itself over the cliff, scooped out the lake at its foot, and then ran on       until it bathed its snout in the waters of Lake Tahoe, and probably formed icebergs there.       In its subsequent retreat it seems to have dropped more debris in its path and formed a       more perfect terminal moraine than did Fallen Leaf Glacier.   Emerald Bay Glacier. All that I have said of Fallen Leaf Lake and Cascade Lake apply,       almost word for word, to Emerald Bay. This beautiful bay, almost a lake, has also been       formed by a glacier. It also is bounded on either side by moraines, which run down to and       even project into Lake Tahoe, and may be traced up to the rocky points which form the       mouth of the canyon at the head of the bay. Its eastern moraine, as already stated, is       partly merged into the western moraine of Cascade Lake, to form a huge medial moraine. Its       western moraine lies partly against a rocky ridge which runs down to Lake Tahoe to form       Rubicon Point. At the head of the bay, as at the head of Cascade Lake, there is a cliff       about 100 feet high, over which the river precipitates itself and forms a beautiful       cascade. Over the lip of this cliff, and in the bed of the canyon above, and up the sides       of the cliff-like walls, 1000 feet or more, the most perfect glaciation is found. The only       difference between this glacier and the two preceding is, that it ran more deeply into the       main lake and the deposits dropped in its retreat did not rise high enough to cut off its       little rock basin from that lake, but exists now only as a shallow bar at the mouth of the       bay. This bar consists of true moraine matter, i.e., intermingled bowlders and sand, which       may be examined through the exquisitely transparent water almost as perfectly as if no       water were present.   92     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   All that I have described separately and in detail, and much more, may be taken in at one       view from the top of Mount Tallac. From this peak nearly the whole course of these three       glaciers, their fountain amphitheaters, their canyon beds, and their lakes enclosed       between their moraine arms, may be seen at once. The view from this peak is certainly one       of the finest that I have ever seen. Less grand and diversified in mountain forms than       many from peaks above the Yosemite, it has added beauty of extensive water surface, and       the added interest of several glacial pathways in a limited space. The observer sits on       the very edge of the fountain amphitheaters still holding large masses of snow;       immediately below, almost at his feet, lie glistening, gem-like, in dark rocky setting,       the three exquisite little iakes; on either side of these, embracing and protecting them,       stretch out the moraine arms, reaching toward and directing the eye to the great Lake,       which lies, map-like, with all its sinuous outlines perfectly distinct, even to its       extreme northern end, twenty-five to thirty miles away. As the eye sweeps again up the       canyon-beds, little lakes, glacier scooped rock basins, filled with ice-cold water, flash       in the sunlight on every side. Twelve or fifteen of these may be seen.   From appropriate positions on the surface of Lake Tahoe, also, all the moraine ridges are       beautifully seen at once, but the glacial lakes and the canyon-beds, of course, cannot be       seen.   There are several questions of a general nature suggested by my examination of these three       glacial pathways, which I have thought best to consider separately.   a. Evidences of the existence of the Great Lake Valley Glacier. On the south shore of Lake       Tahoe, and especially at the northern or lower end of Fallen Leaf Lake, I found many       pebbles and some large bowlders of a beautiful striped agate-like slate. The stripes       consisted of alternate bands of black and translucent white, the latter weathering into       milk-white, or yellowish, or reddish. It was perfectly evident that these fragments were       brought down from the canyon above Fallen Leaf Lake. On ascending this canyon I easily       found the parent rock of these pebbles and bowlders.   GLACIAL HISTORY OF LAKE TAHOE     93   It is a powerful outcropping ledge of beautifully striped siliceous slate, full of       fissures and joints, and easily broken into blacks of all sizes, crossing the canyon about       a half mile above the lake. This rock is so peculiar and so easily identified that its       fragments become an admirable index of the extent of the glacial transportation. I have,       myself, traced these pebbles only a little way along the western shores of the great Lake,       as my observations were principally confined to this part; but I learn from my brother,       Professor John LeConte, and from Mr John Muir, both of whom have examined the pebbles I       have brought home, that precisely similar fragments are found in great abundance all along       the western shore from Sugar Pine Point northward, and especially on the extreme       northwestern shore nearly thirty miles from their source. I have visited the eastern shore       of the Lake somewhat more extensively than the western, and nowhere did I see similar       pebbles. Mr. Muir, who has walked around the Lake, tells me that they do not occur on the       eastern shore. We have, then, in the distribution of these pebbles, demonstrative evidence       of the fact that Fallen Leaf Lake glacier was once a tributary of a much greater glacier       which filled Lake Tahoe.   The only other agency to which we could attribute this transportation is that of shore ice       and icebergs, which probably did once exist on Lake Tahoe; but the limitation of the       pebbles to the western, and especially the northwestern shores, is in exact accordance       with the laws of glacial transportation, but contrary to those of floating ice       transportation     for lake ice is carried only by winds, and would, therefore, deposit       equally on all shores.   Again: I think I find additional evidence of a Lake Tahoe   mer de glace   in the       contrasted character of the northern and southern shores of this Lake.   All the little glacial lakes described above are deep at the upper end and shallow at the       lower end. Further, all of them have a sand beach and a sand flat at the upper end, and       great bowlders thickly scattered in the shallow water, and along the shore at the lower       end. These facts are easily explained, if we remember that while the glacial scooping  was         principally   at   the  upper  end,   the   glacial   94     THE LAKE OF THE SKY     LAKE TAHOE   droppings were principally at the lower end. And further: that while the glacial deposit       was principally at the lower end, the river deposit, since the glacial epoch, has been       wholly at the upper end.   Now the great Lake, also, has a similar structure. It also has a beautiful sand and gravel       beach all along its upper shore, and a sand flat extending above it; while at its lower,       or northern end, thickly strewed in the shallow water, and along the shore line, and some       distance above the shore line, are found in great abundance bowlders of enormous size. May       we not conclude that similar effects have been produced by similar causes     that these       huge bowlders were dropped by the great glacier at its lower end? Similar bowlders are       also found along the northern portion of the eastern shore, because the principal flow of       the ice-current was from the southwest, and in the fulness of glacial times the principal       exit was over the northeastern lip of the basin.   b.  Origin of Lake Tahoe.    That Lake Tahoe was once wholly occupied by ice, I think, is       certain; but that it was scooped out by the Lake Valley glacier is perhaps more doubtful.          All other Sierra lakes which  I have seen certainly owe their  origin  to  glacial        agency.    Neither  do  I think we should be staggered by the size or enormous depth of       this Lake.    Yet, from its position, it may be a plication-hollow, or a trough produced       by the formation of two parallel   mountain   ridges,   and   afterward   modified   by         glacial agency,   instead  of  a  pure  glacial-scooped   rock-basin.    In other words,       Lake Valley, with its two summit ridges, may be  regarded as a phenomenon  belonging to        the  order of mountain-formation and not to the order of mountain sculpture.    I believe       an examination of the rocks of the two summit ridges would probably settle this.    In the       absence of more light than I now have, I will not hazard an opinion.1   c.  Passage of slate into granite.    From the commencement of the rocky canyon at the       head of Fallen Leaf Lake, and up for about two miles, the canyon walls and bed are       composed of slate.    The slate, however, becomes more and more metamorphic as we go up,       until it passes into what   1This question practically has been settled by Mr. Lindgren, and his conclusions aie given       in an earlier chapter.   GLACIAL HISTORY OF LAKE TAHOE     95   much resembles trap. In some places it looks like diorite and in others like porphyry. I       saw no evidence, however, of any outburst. This latter rock passes somewhat more rapidly       into granite at Glen Alpine Springs. From this point the canyon bed and lower walls are       granite, but the highest peaks are still a dark, splintery, metamorphic slate. The glacial       erosion has here cut through the slate and bitten deep into the underlying granite. The       passage from slate through porphyritic diorite into granite may, I think, be best       explained by the increasing degree of metamorphism, and at the same time a change of the       original sediments at this point; granite being the last term of metamorphism of pure       clays, or clayey sandstones, while bedded diorites are similarly formed from ferruginous       and calcareous slates. Just at the junction of the harder and tougher granite with the       softer and more jointed slates, occur, as might be expected, cascades in the river. It is       probable that the cascades at the head of Cascade Lake and Emerald Bay mark, also, the       junction of the granite with the slate     only the junction here is covered with debris.       Just at the same junction, in Fallen Leaf Lake Canyon (Glen Alpine Basin), burst out the       waters of Glen Alpine Springs, highly charged with bicarbonates of iron and soda.   d. Glacial Deltas. I have stated that the moraines of Cascade Lake and Emerald Bay       glaciers run down to the margin of Lake Tahoe. An examination of this portion of the Lake       shore shows that they run far into the Lake     that the Lake has been filled in, two or       three miles, by glacial debris. On the eastern margin of Lake Tahoe, the water, close       along the shore, is comparatively shallow, the shore rocky, and along the shore-line,       above and below the water, are scattered great bowlders, probably dropped by the main       glacier. But on the west margin of the Lake the shoreline is composed wholly of moraine       matter, the water very deep close to shore, and the bottom composed of precisely similar       moraine matter. In rowing along the shore, I found that the exquisite ultramarine blue of       the deep water extends to within 100 to 150 feet of the shore-line. At this distance, the       bottom could barely be seen. Judging from the experiments of my brother, Professor John Le   96     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Conte, according to which a white object could be seen at a depth of 115 feet, I suppose       the depth along the line of junction of the ultramarine blue and the emerald green water       is at least 100 feet. The slope of the bottom is, therefore, nearly, or quite, 45 degrees.       It seems, in fact, a direct continuation beneath the water of the moraine slope. The       materials, also, which may be examined with ease through the wonderfully transparent       water, are exactly the same as that composing the moraine, viz: earth, pebbles, and       bowlders of all sizes, some of them of enormous dimensions. It seems almost certain that       the margin of the great Lake Valley glacier, and of the Lake itself when this glacier had       melted and the tributaries first began to run into the Lake, was the series of rocky       points at the head of the three little lakes, about three or four miles back from the       present margin of the main Lake; and that all lakeward from these points has been filled       in and made land by the action of the three glaciers described. At that time Rubicon Point       was a rocky promontory, projecting far into the Lake, beyond which was another wide bay,       which has been similarly rilled in by debris brought down by glaciers north of this point.       The long moraines of these glaciers are plainly visible from the Lake surface; but I have       not examined them. Thus, all the land, for three or four miles back from the Lake-margin,       both north and south of Rubicon Point, is composed of confluent glacial deltas, and on       these deltas the moraine ridges are the natural levees of these ice-streams.   e. Parallel Moraines. The moraines described above are peculiar and almost unique.       Nowhere, except about Lake Tahoe and near Lake Mono, have I seen moraines in the form of       parallel ridges lying on a level plain and terminating abruptly without any signs of       transverse connection (terminal moraine) at the lower end. Nor have I been able to find       any description of similar moraines in other countries. They are not terminal moraines,       for the glacial pathway is open below. They are not lateral moraines, for these are borne       on the glacier itself, or else stranded on the deep canyon sides. Neither do I think       moraines of this kind would be formed by a glacier emerging from a steep   GLACIAL HISTORY OF LAKE TAHOE     97   narrow canyon and running out on a level plain; for in such cases, as soon as the       confinement of the bounding walls is removed, the ice stream spreads out into an ice lake.       It does so as naturally and necessarily as does water under similar circumstances. The       deposit would be nearly transverse to the direction of the motion, and, therefore, more or       less crescentic. There must be something peculiar in the conditions under which these       parallel ridges were formed.    I believe the conditions were as described below.   We have already given reason to think that the original margin of the Lake, in glacial       times, was three or four miles back from the present margin, along the series of rocky       points against which the ridges abut; and that all the flat plain thence to the present       margin is made land. If so, then it is evident that at that time the three glaciers       described ran far out into the Lake, until reaching deep water, where they formed       icebergs. Under these conditions, it is plain that the pressure on this, the subaqueous       portion of the glacial bed, would be small, and become less and less until it becomes       nothing at the point where the icebergs float away. The pressure on the bed being small,       not enough to overcome the cohesion of ice, there would be no spreading. A glacier running       down a steep narrow canyon and out into the deep water, and forming icebergs at its point,       would maintain its slender, tongue-like form, and drop its debris on each side, forming       parallel ridges, and would not form a terminal moraine because the materials not dropped       previously would be carried off  by icebergs. In the subsequent retreat of such a glacier,       imperfect terminal moraines might be formed higher up, where the water is not deep enough       to form icebergs. It is probable, too, that since the melting of the great   mer de glace         and the formation of the Lake, the level of the water has gone down considerably, by the       deepening of the Truckee Canyon outlet by means of erosion. Thus not only did the glaciers       retreat from the Lake, but also the Lake from the glaciers.   As already stated, similar parallel moraine ridges are formed by the glaciers which ran       down the steep eastern slope of the Sierras, and out on the level plains of Mono. By far       the most remarkable are those formed by Bloody   98     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Canyon Glacier, described by me in a former paper. These moraines are six or seven miles       long, 300 to 400 feet high, and the parallel crests not more than a mile asunder. There,       also, as at Lake Tahoe, we find them terminating abruptly in the plain without any sign of       terminal moraine. But higher up there are small, imperfect, transverse moraines, made       during the subsequent retreat, behind which water has collected, forming lakes and       marshes. But observe: these moraines are also in the vicinity of a great lake; and we have       abundant evidence, in very distinct terraces described by Whitney * and observed by       myself, that in glacial times the water stood at least six hundred feet above the present       level. In fact, there can be no doubt that at that time the waters of Mono Lake (or a much       greater body of water of which Mono is the remnant) washed against the bold rocky points       from which the debris ridges start. The glaciers in this vicinity, therefore, must have       run out into the water six or seven miles, and doubtless formed icebergs at their point,       and, therefore, formed there no terminal moraine.   That the glaciers described about Lake Tahoe and Lake Mono ran out far into the water and       formed icebergs I think is quite certain, and that parallel moraines open below are       characteristic signs of such conditions I also think nearly certain.   /. Glacial Erosion. My observations on glacial pathways in the High Sierra, and especially       about Lake Tahoe, have greatly modified my views as to the nature of glacial erosion.       Writers on this subject seem to regard glacial erosion as mostly, if not wholly, a       grinding and scoring; the debris of this erosion as rock-meal; the great bowlders, which       are found in such immense quantities in the terminal deposit, as derived wholly from the       crumbling cliffs above the glacial surface; the rounded bowlders, which are often the most       numerous, as derived in precisely the same way, only they have been engulfed by crevasses,       or between the sides of the glacier and the bounding wall, and thus carried between the       moving ice and its rocky bed, as between   1 Geological Survey of California, Vol. 1, 451.   GLACIAL HISTORY OF LAKE TAHOE     99   the upper and nether millstone. In a word, all bowlders, whether angular or rounded, are       supposed to owe their origin or separation and shaping to glacial agency.   Now, if such be the true view of glacial erosion, evidently its effect in mountain       sculpture must be small indeed. Roches moutonnees are recognized by all as the most       universal and characteristic sign of a glacial bed. Sometimes these beds are only       imperfect moutonnees, i.e., they are composed of broken angular surface with only the       points and edges planed off. Now, moutonnees surfaces always, and especially angular       surfaces with only points and edges beveled, show that the erosion by grinding has been       only very superficial. They show that if the usual view of glacial erosion be correct, the       great canyons, so far from being formed, were only very slightly modified by glacial       agency. But I am quite satisfied from my own observations, that this is not the only nor       the principal mode of glacial erosion. I am convinced that a glacier, by its enormous       pressure and resistless onward movement, is constantly breaking off large blocks from its       bed and bounding walls. Its erosion is not only a grinding and scoring, but also a       crushing and breaking. It makes by its erosion not only rock-meal, but also large       rock-chips. Thus, a glacier is constantly breaking off blocks and making angular surfaces,       and then grinding off the angles both of the fragments and the bed, and thus forming       rounded bowlders and moutonnees surfaces. Its erosion is a constant process of alternate       rough hewing and planing. If the rock be full of fissures, and the glacier deep and heavy,       the rough hewing so predominates that the plane has only time to touch the corners a       little before the rock is again broken and new angles formed. This is the case high up on       the canyon walls, at the head of Cascade Lake and Emerald Bay, but also in the canyon beds       wherever the slate is approached. If, on the other hand, the rock is very hard and solid,       and the glacier be not very deep and heavy, the planing will predominate over the rough       hewing, and a smooth, gentle billowy surface is the result. This is the case in the hard       granite forming the beds of all the canyons high up, but   ioo   THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   especially high up the canyon of Fallen Leaf Lake (Glen Alpine Basin), where the canyon       spreads out and extensive but comparatively thin snow sheets have been at work. In some       cases on the cliffs, subsequent disintegration of a glacier-polished surface may have       given the appearance of angular surfaces with beveled corners; but, in other cases, in the       bed of the canyon, and on elevated level places, where large loosened blocks could not be       removed by water nor by gravity, I observed the same appearances, under conditions which       forbid this explanation. Mr. Muir, also, in his Studies in the Sierra, gives many examples       of undoubted rock-breaking by ancient glaciers.   Angular blocks are mostly, therefore, the ruins of crumbling cliffs, borne on the surface       of the glacier and deposited at its foot. Many rounded bowlders also have a similar       origin, having found their way to the bed of the glacier through crevasses, or along the       sides of the glacier. But most of the rounded bowlders in the terminal deposit of great       glaciers are fragments torn off by the glacier itself. The proportion of rounded bowlders           of upper or air-formed     to nether or glacier-formed fragments, depends on the depth and       extent of the ice-current. In the case of the universal ice-sheet (ice-flood) there are,       of course, no upper formed or angular blocks at all     there is nothing borne on the       surface. The moraine, therefore, consists wholly of nether-formed and nether-borne       severely triturated materials (moraine profunde). The bowlders are, of course, all       rounded. This is one extreme. In the case of the thin moving ice-fields, the glacierets       which still linger among the highest peaks and shadiest hollows of the Sierra, on the       other hand, the moraines are composed wholly of angular blocks. This is the character of       the terminal moraine of Mount Lyell glacier. These glacierets are too thin and feeble and       torpid to break off fragments     they can only bear away what falls on them. This is the       other extreme. But in the case of ordinary glaciers     ice-streams     the bowlders of the       terminal deposit are mixed; the angular or upper-formed predominating in the small       existing glaciers of temperate climates, but the rounded or nether-formed greatly       predominating in the grand old glaciers of which we have been   GLACIAL HISTORY OF LAKE TAHOE     101   speaking. In the terminal deposits of these, especially in the materials pushed into the       Lake, it is somewhat difficult to find a bowlder which has not been subjected to severe attrition.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER IX   THE LESSER LAKES OF THE TAHOE REGION AND HOW THEY WERE FORMED   THIS is not to be a description of the scores of Glacial Lakes found in the Tahoe region,       but an answer to the questions so often asked about practically all of these lakes, as to       their origin and continuance.   Rich as our Sierras are in treasures none are more precious than these. They give one       pleasing surprises, often when least expected. For while the tree-clusters, the       mountain-peaks, and the glowing snow-banks throw themselves into our view by their       elevated positions, the retiring lakes, secluded, modest, hide their beauty from us until       we happen to climb up to, or above, them.   From the higher summits how wonderfully they appear. Let the eye follow a fruitful branch       of an apple, pear or peach. How the leaves, the stem, the fruit occur, in sure but       irregular order. It is just so with the glacial lakes of the Sierras. They are the fruit       of the streams that flow from the glacial fountains.    They lie on rude and unexpected       granite shelves,       as Le Conte Lake; under the shadow of towering peaks,       as Gilmore Lake; on bald  glacier-gouged and polished tables,    as those of Desolation       Valley; embosomed in deep woods,    as Fallen Leaf, Heather and Cascade; in the rocky       recesses of sloping canyons,    as Susie, Lucile and the Angoras; hidden in secret recesses       of giant granite walls,    as Eagle; or sprawling in the open,    as Loon, Spider, etc.   What a variety of sizes, shapes and characteristics they present.   There are no two       alike, yet they are nearly all   102   THE LESSER LAKES OF TAHOE REGION     103   one in their attractive beauty, in the purity of their waters, and in the glory, majesty,       sublimity and beauty mirrored on their placid faces.   In poetic fashion, yet with scientific accuracy, John Muir thus describes their origin in       his Mountains of California, a book every Tahoe lover should possess:   When a mountain lake is born,    when, like a young eye, it first opens to the light,    it is       an irregular, expressionless crescent, inclosed in banks of rock and ice,    bare, glaciated       rock on the lower side, the rugged snout of a glacier on the upper. In this condition it       remains for many a year, until at length, toward the end of some auspicious cluster of       seasons, the glacier recedes beyond the upper margin of the basin, leaving it open from       shore to shore for the first time, thousands of years after its conception beneath the       glacier that excavated its basin. The landscape, cold and bare, is reflected in its pure       depths; the winds ruffle its glassy surface, and the sun thrills it with throbbing       spangles, while its waves begin to lap and murmur around its leafless shores,          sun-spangles during the day and reflected stars at night its only flowers, the winds and       the snow its only visitors. Meanwhile, the glacier continues to recede, and numerous       rills, still younger than the lake itself, bring down glacier-mud, sand-grains, and       pebbles, giving rise to margin-rings and plats of soil. To these fresh soil-beds come many       a waiting plant. First, a hardy carex with arching leaves and a spike of brown flowers;       then, as the seasons grow warmer, and the soil-beds deeper and wider, other sedges take       their appointed places, and these are joined by blue gentians, daisies, dodecatheons,       violets, honey-worts, and many a lowly moss. Shrubs also hasten in time to the new       gardens,    kalmia with its glossy leaves and purple flowers, the arctic willow, making soft       woven carpets, together with the healthy bryanthus and casiope, the fairest and dearest of       them all. Insects now enrich the air, frogs pipe cheerily in the shallows, soon followed       by the ouzel, which is the first bird to visit a glacier lake, as the sedge is the first       of plants.      104   THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   So the young lake grows in beauty, becoming more and more humanly lovable from century to       century. Groves of aspen spring up, and hardy pines, and the hemlock spruce, until it is       richly overshadowed and embowered. But while its shores are becoming enriched, the       soil-beds creep out with incessant growth, contracting its area, while the lighter       mud-particles deposited on the bottom cause it to grow shallower, until at length the last       remnant of the lake vanishes,     closed forever in ripe and natural old age. And now its       feeding-stream goes winding on without halting through the new gardens and groves that       have taken its place.   The length of the life of any lake depends ordinarily upon the capacity of its basin, as       compared with the carrying power of the streams that flow into it, the character of the       rocks over which these streams flow, and the relative position of the lake toward other       lakes. In a series whose basins lie in the same canyon, and are fed by one and the same       main stream, the uppermost will, of course, vanish first unless some other lake-filling       agent comes in to modify the result; because at first it receives nearly all of the       sediments that the stream brings down, only the finest of the mud-particles being carried       through the highest of the series to the next below. Then the next higher, and the next       would be successively filled, and the lowest would be the last to vanish. But this       simplicity as to duration is broken in upon in various ways, chiefly through the action of       side-streams that enter the lower lakes direct. For, notwithstanding many of these side       tributaries are quite short, and, during late summer, feeble, they all become powerful       torrents in spring-time when the snow is melting, and carry not only sand and       pine-needles, but large trunks and bowlders tons in weight, sweeping them down their       steeply inclined channels and into the lake basins with astounding energy. Many of these       side affluents also have the advantage of access to the main lateral moraines of the       vanished glacier that occupied the canyon, and upon these they draw for lake-filling       material, while the main trunk stream flows mostly over clean glacier pavements, where but       little moraine matter is ever left for them to carry. Thus a small rapid  stream  with        abundance  of  loose  transportable  ma-      TAMARACK AND ECHO LAKES   CASCADE LAKE, NEAR THE AUTOMOBILE BOULEVARD, LAKE.   MEMORIAL CROSS AT DONNER LAKE   THE LESSER LAKES OF TAHOE REGION      105   terial within its reach may fill up an extensive basin in a few centuries, while a large       perennial trunk stream, flowing over clean, enduring pavements, though ordinarily a       hundred times larger, may not fill a smaller basin in thousands of years.   Many striking examples of these successive processes may be seen in the Tahoe region, as,       for instance, Squaw Valley, which lies between the spurs of Squaw Peak and Granite Chief.       This was undoubtedly scooped out by a glacier that came down from Squaw Peak and Granite       Chief. The course of the ice-sheet was down to the Truckee River. When the glacier began       to shrink it left its terminal moraine as a dam between the basin above and the river       below. In due time, as the glacier finally receded to a mere bank of half-glacierized snow       on the upper portions of the two peaks, the basin filled up with water and thus formed a       lake. Slowly the sand and rocky debris from the peaks filled up the lake, and in the       course of time a break was made in the moraine, so that the creek flowed over or through       it and the lake ceased to exist, while the meadow came into existence.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER X   DONNER  LAKE   AND  ITS  TRAGIC   HISTORY   CLOSELY allied to Lake Tahbe by its near proximity, its situation on the Emigrant Gap       automobile road from Sacramento to Tahoe, and that it is seen from Mt. Rose, Mt. Watson,       and many Tahoe peaks, is Donner Lake,    lake of tragic memories in the early day pioneer       history of this region.   It was in 1846 that James T. Reed, of Springfield, III., determined to move to California.       This land of promise was then a Mexican province, but Reed carefully and thoroughly had       considered the question and had decided that, for his family's good, it was well to       emigrate. He induced two other Illinois families to accompany him, those of George and       Jacob Donner. Thursday, April 15th, 1846, the party started, full of high hopes for the       future. The story of how they met with others bound for California or Oregon, at       Independence, Mo., journeyed together over the plains and prairies to Fort Hall, where       Lansford W. Hastings, either in person or by his   Open Letter,  led part of the band to       take his new road, which ultimated in dire tragedy, is well known.   The Oregon division of the divided party took the right-hand trail, while the other took       the left-hand to Fort Bridger. It is the experiences of this latter party with which we       are concerned. Misfortune came to them thick and fast from this time on. The wagons were       stalled in Weber Canyon and had to be hauled bodily up the steep cliffs to the   106   DONNER LAKE AND ITS HISTORY      107   plateau above; some of their stock ran away, after heartbreaking struggles over the Salt       Lake desert; mirages intensified their burning thirst by their disappointing lure; Indians       threatened them, and finally, to add despair to their wretchedness, a quarrel arose in       which Mr. Reed, in self-defence, killed one of the drivers, named Snyder. Reed was       banished from the party under circumstances of unjustifiable severity which amounted to       inhuman cruelty, and his wife and helpless children, the oldest of them, Virginia, only       twelve years of age, had to take the rest of the journey without the presence of their       natural protector. Food supplies began to give out, the snow fell earlier than usual and       added to their difficulties, and before they reached the region of the Truckee River they       were compelled to go on short rations. Then, under suspicious circumstances one of the       party, Wolfinger, was lost, and though his wife was informed that he had been murdered by       Indians, there was always a doubt in the minds of some as to whether that explanation were       the true one. On the 19th of October, an advance guard that had gone on to California for       food, returned, bringing seven mules ladened with flour and jerked beef. The story of this       trip I have recounted more fully in the book Heroes of California. Without this additional       food the party never could have survived. On the 22nd they crossed the Truckee River for       the forty-ninth time.   Heavy snow now began to intercept their weary way. They were finally compelled to take       refuge in an abandoned cabin near the shore of what is now known as Donner Lake, and       there, under circumstances of horror and terror that can never fully be comprehended and       appreciated, the devoted men, women and children were imprisoned in the snow until the       first relief party reached them, February 19th, with scant provisions, brought in at       life's peril on snowshoes. A   Forlorn Hope  had tried to force its passage over the      io8   THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   snowy heights. Fifteen brave men and women determined to see if they could not win their       way over and send back help. Out of the fifteen seven only survived and reached the       Sacramento Valley, and they were compelled to sustain life by eating the flesh of those       who had perished.   The second relief party was organized by Mr. Reed,    the banished leader     and thirty-one       of the party were still in camp at Donner Lake when he arrived, with nine stalwart men to       help, on March ist. On the 3rd nine of them left, with seventeen of the starving       emigrants, but they were caught in a fearful snow-storm as they crossed the summit, and       ten miles below were compelled to go into camp. Their provisions gave out, Mrs. Graves       died, leaving an emaciated babe in arms and three other children, one a five-year-old, who       died the next day. Isaac Donner died the third night. Reed and Greenwood, carrying Reed's       two children, Mattie and James Jr., with one of the survivors who could walk, now       struggled down the mountain in the hope that they could reach help to go back and finish       the rescue work. These met Mr. Woodworth who organized the third relief party, of seven       men, who returned to   Starved Camp,  to find the survivors begging piteously for       something to eat. This relief party divided into two parts     one to go over the summit to       give help to the needy there, the other to get the   Starved Camp  remnant to safety. The       first section succeeded in their mission of mercy and a few days later caught up with the       other section from Starved Camp.   Mr. C. F. McGlashan, formerly editor of the Truckee Republican, has written a graphic       account, with great care and desire for accuracy, of the complete expedition, which gives       the heart-rending story with completeness, and I expect to publish ere long the personal       story of Virginia Reed Murphy, who is still alive, one of the few survivors of the       ill-fated party.   THE STEAMER AT THE WHARF, TAHOE TAVERN, LAKE TAHOE   DONNER LAKE, ON THE AUTOMOBILE HIGHWAY FROM SACRAMENTO TO TRUCKEE AND LAKE TAHOE   THE CANYON OF THE TRUCKEE RIVER IN WINTER      AUTOMOBILING ALONG THE PICTURESQUE TRUCKEE RIVER, ON THE WAY TO LAKE TAHOE   DONNER LAKE AND ITS HISTORY      109   Through privations and hardships untold the survivors were ultimately enabled to reach       Sutter's Fort, only to find the most vile and fearful stories set in circulation about       them. Four separate relief parties were sent from California, and their adventures were       almost as tragic as those of the sufferers they sought to help. Bret Harte, in his Gabriel       Conroy, has told much     though in the exaggerated and unjust form the stories were first       circulated     of the Donner tragedy, and it has been made the subject of much newspaper and       other writing and discussion.   An unusual trip that can be taken from Tahoe Tavern is down to the foot of Donner Lake and       then, turning to the left, follow the old emigrant and stage-road. It has not been used       for fifty years, but it is full of interest. There are many objects that remain to tell of       its fascinating history. Over it came many who afterwards became pioneers in hewing out       this new land from the raw material of which lasting commonwealths are made. Turning south       to Cold Stream, it passes by Summit Valley on to Starved Camp. The stumps of the trees cut       down by the unfortunate pioneers are still standing.   It was always a difficult road to negotiate, the divide between Mt. Lincoln and Anderson       Peak being over 7500 feet high. But those heroes of 1848-49 made it, triumphing over every       barrier and winning for themselves what Joaquin Miller so poetically has accorded them,       where he declares that   the snow-clad Sierras are their everlasting monuments.    This road is now, in places, almost obliterated. One section for three miles is grown up.       Trees and chaparral cover it and hide it from the face of any but the most studiously       observant. When the road that takes to the north of Donner Lake was built in 1861-62 and       goes directly and on an easier grade by Emigrant Gap to Dutch Flat, this   110   THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   road by Cold Stream was totally abandoned. For years the county road officials have       ignored its existence, and now it is as if it never had been, save for its memories and       the fragments of wagons, broken and abandoned in the fierce conflict with stern Nature,       and suggesting the heart-break and struggle the effort to reach California caused in those    early days.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XI   LAKE TAHOE AND THE TRUCKEE  RIVER   AS is well known, the Truckee River is the only outlet to Lake Tahoe. This outlet is on the northwest side of the Lake, between Tahoe City and Tahoe Tavern, and is now entirely controlled by the concrete dam and head-gates referred to in the chapter on   Public uses of the Water of Lake Tahoe.    When Fremont came down from Oregon in 1844, he named the river Salmon Trout River, from the excellent fish found therein, but the same year, according to Angel, in his History of Nevada, a party of twenty-three men, enthused by the glowing accounts they had heard of California, left Council Bluffs, May 20th, crossed the plains in safety, and reached the Humboldt River. Here an Indian, named Truckee, presented himself to them and offered to become their guide. After questioning him closely, they engaged him, and as they progressed, found that all his statements were verified. He soon became a great favorite among them, and when they reached the lower crossing of the river (now Wadsworth), they were so pleased by the pure water and the abundance of the fish to which he directed them, that they named the stream   Truckee   in his honor.   This Capt. Truckee was the chief of the Paiutis, and the father of Winnemucca (sometimes known as Poito), and the grandfather of Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins, long known in Boston and other eastern cities, where she lectured un-   iii   H2     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   der the patronage of Mrs. Horace Mann, Mrs. Ole Bull, Miss Longfellow, and other prominent women, as the Princess Sallie. When I first went to Nevada, over thirty-three years ago, I soon got to know her and her father, Win-nemucca, and met them constantly.   Sarah always claimed that Truckee and Fremont were great friends and that it was the Pathfinder who named the river after her grandfather, but nowhere in his Report of the 1843   44 Expedition does he mention Truckee, and he called the river the   Salmon Trout River ; and this name he retained both in the report and map published in his Memoirs of My Life, Vol. I only of which was issued by Belford, Clarke and Company, of Chicago, in 1887.   Hence Sallie is undoubtedly mistaken in this regard. But on several points she is correct, and too great emphasis cannot be laid upon these facts. They are, I, that Truckee guided several emigrant parties, even as far as Sut-ter's Fort, California (where Sacramento, the Capital of the State, now stands) ; II, that he was always friendly, true and honest in his dealings with the whites; III, that had the emigrants and settlers in Nevada treated him as honestly as he did them there would never have been any conflicts between the Paiutis and the whites; IV, that when the latter first came to the country he called councils of his people and bade them welcome the newcomers with open arms.   He died just as the wrongs inflicted upon the Paiutis were making them desperate and resolved on war. Though his son, Winnemucca, is well known never openly to have waged war against the whites, it was thoroughly understood that secretly he favored it. But had his father lived and retained his health and power there is little doubt but that the open conflict would have been averted, and many precious human lives on both sides saved.   LAKE TAHOE AND TRUCKEE RIVER      113   The Truckee River has its rise in Lake Tahoe, flows northward and breaks through the Mount Pluto ridge in a narrow canyon, one thousand to two thousand feet in depth. While the canyon is narrow and its slopes, especially on the east, are rocky and steep, it is not exactly gorge-like, except for the space of a mile or so, a short distance below Tahoe. For twelve miles the river follows a northerly course, and it is then joined by Donner Creek flowing from Donner Lake. The united streams then turn eastward and take a course across the northern end of the gravelly flat of Martis Valley, in a channel two hundred to two-hundred-fifty feet below the level of the plain. At Boca it cuts through the eastern range with a canyon one thousand to three thousand five hundred feet in depth and emerges on the plains of Nevada between Verdi and Reno. It returns again to the north below Wadsworth, having run sixty-nine miles from Donner Creek, and then, flowing sixteen more miles, it discharges into Pyramid Lake. At Tahoe the river begins at an elevation of 6225 feet above sea level; at Pyramid the level is 4890 feet, thus giving the river a fall of 1335  feet in ninety-seven miles.   The Truckee River receives a number of large tributaries; the principal ones being Little Truckee River and Prosser Creek, the former heading in Webber Lake, the latter in the main range of the Sierras, most of its sources lying in small lakes held in hollows and basins excavated by glaciers.   Until it was contaminated by the refuse of civilization its waters were pure and healthful, but legal enactments have been necessary to protect the stream from sawdust and other pollutions.   As elsewhere explained the Truckee River being the only outlet of Lake Tahoe, and therefore its natural outflow channel, together with the facts that its origin is in Cali-   ii4     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   fornia and it then flows into Nevada, and that part of Lake Tahoe is in each state, has helped complicate the solution of the question as to who is entitled to the surplus waters of the Lake. This is discussed somewhat in a later chapter devoted to the subject.   It may be interesting to recall that in 1900 Mr. A. W. Von Schmidt, President of the Lake Tahoe and San Francisco Water Works, offered to sell to the City of San Francisco certain rights to the water of Lake Tahoe, the dam at the outlet, contract for a deed to two and a half acres of land on which the outlet dam was constructed, a diverting dam in the Truckee River, a patent to the land (forty acres) on which this land stood, and the maps and surveys for a complete line conveying the water of Lake Tahoe to the city of the Golden Gate. He offered to construct this line, including a tunnel through the Sierra Nevadas, and deliver thirty million gallons of water daily, for  17,960,000. If a double line, or a hundred millions of gallons daily, were required, the price was to be correspondingly increased.   This proposition aroused the people of Nevada, and R. L. Fulton, of Reno, Manager of the State Board of Trade, wrote to the San Francisco supervisors, calling attention to the facts that there was no surplus water from Tahoe during the irrigation season, for the water had been diverted by the farmers living along the Truckee River to their fields; that flouring-mills, smelting and reduction works, electric light plant and water-works at Reno, immense saw-mills, a furniture factory, box factory, water and electric-light works, railroad water-tanks, etc., at Truckee, half a dozen ice-ponds, producing over 200,000 tons of ice annually, sawmills and marble-working mills at Essex; planing-mills at Verdi,  paper-mill  at Floristan,  and  other similar plants,   LAKE TAHOE AND TRUCKEE RIVER     115   were totally dependent  for their water supply upon  the Truckee River.   He also claimed (what was the well-known fact) that the Von Schmidt dam was burned out many years ago, and that Nevada would put up a tremendously stiff fight to prevent any such diversion of Tahoe water as was contemplated. Needless to say the plan fell through.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XII   BY RAIL TO  LAKE  TAHOE   LAKE TAHOE is fifteen miles from Truckee, which is one of the mountain stations on the       main line of the Southern Pacific Railway (Central Route), two hundred and eight miles       from San Francisco, thirty-five miles from Reno,  Nevada, and five hundred and       seventy-four miles from Ogden, Utah.    By the San Joaquin Valley route via Sacramento,       the distance to Los Angeles is five hundred  and  eighty miles,  or by  San  Francisco and        the Coast Line six hundred and ninety-two miles.   During the summer season trains run frequently through, making Tahoe easily accessible.   From the east the traveler comes over what is practically the long known and historic       overland stage-road, over which so many thousands of gold-seekers and emigrants came in       the days of California's gold excitement. Every mile has some story of pioneer bravery or       heroism, of hairbreadth escape from hostile Indians or fortuitous deliverance from storm       or disaster. It was over this route the pilgrims came who sought in Utah a land of freedom       where they might follow their own peculiar conceptions of religion and duty, untrammeled       and uninterfered with by hostile onlookers and disbelievers. Here came the home-seekers of       the earlier day, when California was still a province of Mexico; those who had been lured       by the glowing stories of the Land of the Sun Down Sea, where orange and lemon, vine and       fig flourished and indicated the semi-tropic luxuriance and fruitfulness of the land.   116   TRUCKEE, CALIF., WHERE TRAVELERS TAKE TRAINS FOR LAKE TAHOE   CROSSING THE TRUCKEE RIVER NEAR DEER PARK STATION   PLACERVILLE, EL  DORACO CO., CALIFORNIA   VINEYARD ON THE AUTOMOBILE HIGHWAY BETWEEN PLACERVILLE AND LAKE TAUOE   BY RAIL TO LAKE TAHOE              117   From the west the railroad traverses, in the main, the continuation of this old overland       road. After leaving the fertile valley of the Sacramento and rising into the glorious       foot-hills of the Sierras, every roll of the billows of the mountains and canyons wedged       in between is redolent of memories of the argonauts and emigrants. Yonder are Yuba, Dutch       Flat, the North Fork, the South Fork (of the American River), Colfax, Gold Run, Midas,       Blue Canyon, Emigrant Gap, Grass Valley, Michigan Bluff, Grizzly Gulch, Alpha, Omega,       Eagle Bird, Red Dog, Chips Flat, Quaker Hill and You Bet. Can you not see these camps,       alive with rough-handed, full-bearded, sun-browned, stalwart men, and hear the clang of       hammer upon drill, the shock of the blast, the wheeling away and crash of waste rock as it       is thrown over the dump pile?   And then, as we look up and forward into the sea of mountain-waves into the heart of which       we ride, who but Joaquin Miller can describe the scene?   Here lifts the land of clouds     Fierce mountain forms,   Made white with everlasting snows, look down   Through mists of many canyons, mighty storms   That stretch from Autumn's purple drench and drown   The yellow hem of Spring.    Tall cedars frown   Dark-brow'd, through banner'd clouds that stretch and stream   Above the sea from snowy mountain crown.   The heavens roll, and all things drift or seem   To drift about and drive like some majestic dream.   And it is in the very bosom of this majestic scenery that Lake Xahoe lies enshrined. Its       entrancing beauty is such that we do not wonder that these triumphant monarchs of the         upper seas   cluster around it as if in reverent adoration, and that they wear their       vestal virgin robes of purest white in token of the purity of their worship.   Thoughts like these flood our hearts and minds as we reach Truckee, the point where we       leave the Southern Pacific cars and change to those of the narrow-gauge Lake      n8     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Tahoe Railway and Transportation Company. After a brief wait, long enough to allow       transfer of baggage, we leave, from the same station, for the fifteen miles' ride to Tahoe       Tavern on the very edge of the Lake.   This ride is itself romantic and beautiful. On the day trains observation cars are       provided, and the hour is one of delightful, restful and enchanting scenes. The Truckee       River is never out of sight and again and again it reminds one in its foaming speed of       Joaquin Miller's expressive phrase:   See where the cool white river runs.   Before 19OO this ride used to be taken by stage, the railway having been built in that       year. It is interesting here to note that the rails, the locomotives, the passenger and       freight cars were all transported bodily across the Lake from Glen-brook, on the Nevada       side. There they were in use for many years mainly for hauling logs and lumber to and from       the mills on the summit, whence it was   flumed   to Carson City.   In those days logging was carried on in the Truckee River Canyon and the visitor would       often have the pleasure of seeing logs  shoot the chutes  into the river, by which they       were floated to the mills at Truckee.    Here is a picture:   Tree, bush, and flower grow and blossom upon either side; and a little bird, with a throat       like a thrush, warbles a canticle of exquisite musical modulations, so to speak. But the       most stirring sight of all is the system of logging carried on by the mill companies.        Look  Quick   ejaculates the driver; and your gaze is directed to a monster log that       comes furiously dashing from the summit down a chute a thousand feet in length with twice       the ordinary speed of a locomotive. So rapid is its descent that it leaves a trail of       smoke behind it, and sometimes kindles a fire among the slivers along its way. Ah  it       strikes the water  In an instant there is an inverted Niagara in the air, resplendent with       prismatic and transparent veils of spray.1   1 John Vance Cheney in Lippincotfs.   BY RAIL TO LAKE TAHOE              119   The main portion of the canyon is walled in by abrupt acclivities, upon which majestic       trees used to grow, but where now only the growth of the past twenty-five to fifty years       is found, doing its best to hide the scars and wounds of the logging days.   The river, issuing from the Lake above, dashes down its wild way in resistless freedom. It       is a rapid, all but savage stream, widening occasionally into sheltered pools exceedingly       dark and deep. The bowlders in its channel, and those crowding down into it from its       farther bank, cause it to eddy and foam with fierce but becoming pride.   A few miles from the Tavern we pass the scene of the Squaw Valley mining excitement where       the two towns of Knoxville and Claraville arose as if by magic, tent cities of thousands       of inhabitants, lured hither by a dream of gold, too soon to fade away, leaving nothing       but distress behind.   Deer Park station suggests the leaving point for that charmingly picturesque resort,       snuggling in the heart of Bear Canyon. Now we pass the masses of tuffaceous breccia that         Pap   Church, the old stage-driver used to call the Devil's Pulpit, and the devil's this       and that or the other, until many a traveler would wish they were all with the devil.   This is a remnant of the vast mass of volcanic rock that in long ago prehistoric times was       poured out in molten sheets over the region, and that formed the range we shall shortly       see at the north end of the Lake     the Mount Pluto range. At some later period either       earthquake convulsion started the break which ultimately eroded and disintegrated into the       great gorge through which the railway has brought us, or grinding glacier cut the pathway       for us.   Here, on the right, is a tiny swinging foot-bridge over the river. This is the beginning,       the suggestion, for the vast suspension bridges that have allowed the world to cross the      120     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   great North River from New York to Brooklyn, and that span great rivers and gorges       elsewhere in the world. Nay  scarcely the beginning. That you find further up and deeper       down in the High Sierras and their shaded and wooded canyons, where wild vines throw their       clinging tendrils across from one shore to another of foaming creeks, and gradually grow       in girth and strength until they form bridges, over which chipmunks, squirrels,       porcupines, 'coons, coyotes, and finally mountain lions, bears, and even men cross with       safety. There is the real origin of the suspension bridge. But this is a miniature, a       model, a suggestion of the big bridges. It affords ready access to the house on the other       side. In winter, however, the boards are taken up, as the heavy snows that fall and       accumulate might wreck it.   It is hard to realize that, a few months from now, when winter begins, this railroad must       perforce cease its operations. Snow falls, here, where the sun is now smiling so       beneficently upon laughing meadows, dotted here and there with dainty flowers, to a depth       of ten and even twenty feet. The mail     necessarily much reduced in winter     is first of       all carried in sleighs, then, as the snows deepen, on snow-shoes, so that those who stay       to preserve the   summer hotels  from winter's ravages may not feel entirely shut out from       the living world beyond.   But there is nothing that suggests snow now. We are enjoying the delights of a summer day       or evening, and know that we are near our journey's end. Suddenly there is a long call of       the whistle, a short curve, and if in the daytime, the Lake suddenly appearst or, if at       night, the lights of the Tavern, and our rail journey is done. We are deposited in       Fairyland, for whether it be day or evening, the Lake or the Tavern, our senses are       thrilled and charmed by everything that appears.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XIII   THE  WISHBONE   AUTOMOBILE  ROUTE  TO  AND  AROUND LAKE  TAHOE   THIS is the name given to the 260-mile automobile route to and from Lake Tahoe, going in       from Sacramento over the world-famed Emigrant Gap and Donner Lake road, around the western       shore of Lake Tahoe, from Tahoe Tavern to Tallac, and thence back to Sacramento over the       historic and picturesque Placerville road. While both of the two main arms of the         wishbone  carry the traveler over the Sierras, the roads are wonderfully different. On the       Emigrant Gap arm the road seems to have been engineered somewhat after the Indian fashion,       viz., to allow the wildest and most expansive outlooks, while the Placerville route is       largely confined to the picturesque and beautiful canyon of the South Fork of the American       River. Both have honored histories and both are fascinating from the scenic standpoint and       the difference in the two routes merely accentuates the charm of the trip, when compared       with the new portion of the road, the connecting link that binds them together and now       makes possible the ride around the lake shore. Experience has demonstrated, however, that       it is better to make the circuit as herein outlined.   A brief sketch of the history of the building of the Emigrant Gap portion of this road       cannot fail to be of interest.   It was practically followed by a host of the emigrants who sought   California   during         the   great   gold   excitement   of   121   122     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   1848-9. It was also one of the earliest routes used between Sacramento and the mines of       the High Sierras. In 1849 it was established from Sacramento to Auburn, Grass Valley and       Nevada City and to-day there is practically little deviation from the original route. In       1850 the mines on the Forest Hill Divide were discovered and a branch road from Auburn was       built to that section. At Illinoistown (now Colfax) the road branched, one arm crossing       the North Fork of the American River to Iowa Hill and other camps on that divide, while       the main road continued up the Sierras to Gold Run, Dutch Flat and other points higher up.   Until the Central Pacific Railway was built in the 'sixties Illinoistown was the junction       for the different Camps in Nevada County and the Bear River and Iowa Hill Divides. The       population of these regions in those early days was much greater than at the present time,       yet the demands of the modern automobile have so improved the roads that they are much       superior to what the large population of those days enjoyed.   In 1862 the California legislature authorized the supervisors of certain counties to call       special elections to vote upon the question as to whether those counties should subscribe       towards the building of the Central Pacific Railway, and to authorize them to issue bonds       for the amounts they decided to expend. San Francisco county subscribed  1,000,000,       Sacramento county  300,000 and Placer county  250,000.   In 1863 the Railroad Company began its work of grading the road bed at Sacramento, and       yet, in 1865 it was only completed to Alta, a distance of 68 miles. At the same time it       was making strenuous efforts to divert passenger and freight traffic for Virginia City and       other Nevada points from the Placerville route.   This had become possible be-   THE WISHBONE AUTOMOBILE ROUTE     123   cause of the fact that when the railway line was actually built as far as Newcastle the       engineers realized that before they could build the rest of their railroad they would need       to construct a highway of easy grade, which would enable them to haul the necessary       supplies for constructing the tunnels, cuts and bridges. Accordingly a survey was made up       to Truckee, over the Nevada line into Reno and Virginia City, securing the best possible       grade for a wagon road, and this was rushed to a hasty completion.   Naturally, they were anxious to gain all the paying traffic possible, and especially under       the adverse conditions under which they were laboring. But, needless to say, this caused       the fiercest hostility on the part of their competitors, laid them open to serious       charges, which, later, were made, and that for a time threatened desperate consequences,       as I will now proceed to relate.   In the late fall of 1864 the Sacramento Valley Railroad (the rival of the Central Pacific)       arranged to make a record trip from Freeport to Virginia City by the Placerville route.       Though the officials endeavored to keep the matter secret, it leaked out and immediately       the Central Pacific planned to circumvent their aim. They stationed relays along their own       line to compete, and Nature and Fate seemed to come to their aid. A fierce storm arose the       day before the start was to be made, and it fell heavier on the Placerville than on the       other route. Though the drivers of each line did their utmost, feeling their own personal       honor, as well as that of their company at stake, the heavy rains at Strawberry arrested       the Placerville stage and made further progress impossible, while the other route was       enabled to complete its trip on record time. Mr. L. L. Robinson, the Superintendent of the       Sacramento Valley Railroad, who himself accompanied the stage, wired from Strawberry,         Heavy rains, heavy roads, slow time      reluctant to own   124     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   a possible defeat. But the Sacramento Union, the organ of the Central Pacific, came out       the next morning with glowing accounts of the successful run of the stages over the       Emigrant Gap route and ridiculed Mr. Robinson's telegram, ironically comparing it with       Caesar's classic message to the Roman Senate:     Veni, Vidi, Vici.    It was such struggles for local business as this that led the San Francisco Alta       California, a paper bitterly opposed to the Central Pacific, to denounce the railway, in       1866, as the   Dutch Flat Swindle.  It claimed that the railway would never be built       further than Alta and that it was built so far only for the purpose of controlling       passenger and freight traffic over their wagon road to Virginia City and other Nevada       points. Other San Francisco papers joined in the fight and so energetically was it       conducted, and so powerful became the opposition that they actually prevailed upon the       people of San Francisco to repudiate their contract to purchase a million dollars' worth       of Central Pacific stock and compromise by practically making the railroad company a       present of  600,000 (which had already been expended) provided they would release the City       and County from their pledge to raise the remaining  400,000.   The folly of this action is now so apparent that it is hard to conceive how even political       and civic jealousy or hatred could have been so blinded to self-interest. The Central       Pacific engineers had undertaken one of the most difficult pieces of railway engineering       in the world, and the financiers of the company were having an equally desperate struggle.       During the Civil War the finances of the nation were at a low ebb and money was       exceedingly difficult to secure. Yet in spite of all obstacles the company had gone ahead       in perfect good faith, and at that very time were hauling rails and track material from       Alta, and soon from  Cisco,  to Truckee   (then called  Coburn  Station  on   AUTOMOBILING ALONG THE TRUCKEE RIVER   ON THE AUTOMOBILE BOULEVARD AROUND LAKE TAHOE   ATLANTIC TO PACIFIC AUTOMOBILE PARTY, PREMIER TOUR, 1911, STOPPING AT TAHOE TAVERN   Copyright  1910, by Harold A.  Parker.   CASCADE LAKE AND MT. TALLAC   THE WISHBONE AUTOMOBILE ROUTE      125   the old Emigrant Gap road), and had actually built the railroad from Truckee down into       Nevada and as far east as Wadsworth, or a little beyond, before the tunnel at Summit was       completed.   Thus in storm and stress was this road born, and in the winter time of our day it is still       a road of storm and stress, as are all of the roads over the High Sierras. It must be       remembered that while the elevation at Sacramento is but thirty feet above sea level, at       Summit it is 7018 feet, and even at Truckee, where the turn is made for Tahoe, it is 5819       feet. Naturally such high altitudes receive considerable snow, which render the roads       impassable during the winter season. In 1914 I went from Truckee to the Summit on the 10th       of June, and save for two or three patches of snow which were rapidly melting, there were       no serious obstacles that any good motor could not overcome.   FROM SACRAMENTO TO TAHOE ON THE EMIGRANT GAP AND DONNER  LAKE ROUTE,   135   MILES   From Sacramento the grade is easy and the country fairly open until Auburn is reached (35       1/2 miles.) The roads are excellent, the disintegrated granite affording local material       close at hand for perfect road building. The Sierras stretch away to the east in gently       ascending billows, covered over with richest verdure of native trees of every variety, and       of the thousands of orchard trees that are making this region as famous for its fruits as       it used to be for its mines. For from 1849 until the hydraulic mines were closed down by       the anti-debris decision in the U. S. Supreme Court, this section and beyond was one of       the richest gold mining regions of California, and historically, one of the greatest       importance to the State. Such places as Auburn, Illinoistown (Colfax), Gold Run and Dutch       Flat, were rich producing camps and branch roads reached to Yankee Jim, Todd's      126     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Valley, Forest Hill, Michigan Bluffs, Bath, and other towns on what is known as the Forest       Hill Divide, a divide being a local term, to signify the rocky, mountainous mass,    nearly       always having a level grade on its summit,    that separates two forks of the same stream,       or two different streams. From Colfax another road led to Grass Valley, Nevada City, and       North Bloomfield in Nevada County, and Iowa Hill, Wisconsin Hill, Monona Flat, and       Damascus on the Iowa Hill Divide. All these were centers of rich mining districts which       were scenes of the greatest activity in the days of their productivity. Now, however, most       of them are abandoned, except Auburn, Colfax, and Nevada City which have other resources,       and Grass Valley, which maintains its high standing owing to its rich quartz mines. Forest       Hill, Iowa Hill, and Michigan Bluff have drift mines which maintain small and meager       populations compared with those of the early and prosperous days. In the 'fifties Yankee       Jim and its tributary mines had a population of 3000, while to-day it is entirely       deserted. Todd's Valley, which was also a flourishing camp has suffered the same fate.   Auburn to Colfax 16 Miles, Colfax to Emigrant Gap, 30 2 Miles. Leaving Auburn the road       ascends more rapidly until Colfax (16 miles) is reached (elevation 2422 feet). Then ten       miles further one is in the heart of the most extensive hydraulic mining operations of       California. Thousands of acres are passed which yet bear the scars of the   washing down         for the precious mineral hid away during the centuries until the Argonauts of '49 and       later unearthed it by their gigantic hydraulic nozzles. Millions of dollars were extracted       from these placers, but now the villages are deserted and all mining operations have       ceased. The time is not far distant when automobile parties will arrange to stop over in       one of these little places, and with a com-   THE WISHBONE AUTOMOBILE ROUTE     127   petent guide, go over the deserted placers. It is hard to realize that by the mere power       of water mountains were washed away, leaving the denuded country on the one hand, a land       of mounds and hummocks, like the Bad Lands in miniature, and on the other hand of masses       of debris, too heavy to be washed away into the streams.   The wildest portions of the Sierras are revealed in ascending from Dutch Flat to the       Summit. The snowsheds of the Southern Pacific Railway come into sight, perched like       peculiar long black boxes, with peep-holes, along an impossible ledge of the massive       granite cliffs, and the Sierran trees tower upright from every possible vantage ground in       the granite beneath.   At Towle, three miles beyond Dutch Flat, the shipping point is reached from which much of       the material was hauled for the building of Lake Spaulding dam. Hundreds of teams were       employed in this work, and the road showed an almost unbroken procession for months. This       was in 1912-13. A side trip to this remarkable dam, impounding the waters of the High       Sierras for the generation of electric power to be used not only in the Sacramento Valley       but in far away San Francisco, cannot fail to be of interest. The area of the Lake, with       the dam at its present elevation, is such as to justify the assertion that it is next to       if not the largest artificial lake in the world.   Emigrant Gap to Cisco, 14 Miles.   Fourteen miles from Towle, after enjoying the rich blue       haze of Blue Canyon, the road passes through the natural Sierran pass at Emigrant Gap       which gives its name to the route. Here one who has not been over the road before must not       fail to note the following : As he passes through the Gap the massive granite wall towers       in dominant power to the right and leads one to feel that miles of rugged peaks are there.       Yet net more than a hundred yards farther on, the wall fades away, and if he   128     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   stops here, and turns off the road slightly to the right, he will glimpse a vision of       glory and sublimity that will take away his breath. Here, from a thousand or two thousand       feet almost sheer above it, one gazes down to where in peaceful repose lies Bear Valley, a       rich emerald green meadow, on the right side of which flows the South Fork of the Yuba       River, and on the left heads Bear Creek, which empties into the Sacramento at Marysville.       Ten, fifteen, twenty minutes are always spent here by those who know of this delectable       surprise, yet many come over the road unheeding and are never aware of what they have       missed.   Eight miles beyond Emigrant Gap, at Cisco, one sees a branch road which leads to the old       Meadow Lake Mining District, which in the 'sixties had a population of several thousands.       A large town was built there, which is now totally abandoned.   Cisco to Summit, 13 Miles. At Summit a marvelous view is had in both directions, east and       west. Westward the fall of the Sierras into the Sacramento Valley is apparently so gentle       and easy as to lead one to wonder that he has risen so high, but eastward the descent is       much more steep and abrupt. The rude granite in many places is almost barren though       Sierran trees abound. The grade is easy, and the new grade and tunnel under the Southern       Pacific tracks makes an added improvement. Almost immediately on emerging from this tunnel       the full glory of the eastern view is forced upon the attention. At one's feet,       apparently, lies the placid surface of Donner Lake, its pure blue giving one a premonitory       foretaste of the richer blues that await him at Tahoe, while beyond are the mountains that       overlook the .Great Basin of Nevada.   Summit to Truckee, 11 Miles. Rapidly the road descends, well engineered and easy to       negotiate to any responsible driver, and before one is aware he is bowling along on   THE WISHBONE AUTOMOBILE ROUTE      129   the level Donner Boulevard, which is as perfect a piece of country road as can be found       anywhere on earth. The Monument (not yet completed) erected by the Native Sons to the       memory of the Donner Lake pioneers, and the Memorial Cross, erected on the spot where the       unhappy party camped, are passed and in a few minutes Truckee is reached. This was once       the scene of great lumber activities but now much reduced, although it is the shipping       point for Hobarts Mills, which is one of the largest lumber camps of the West.   Here the road to Tahoe turns sharply to the south, and the fifteen miles run to the Tavern       is made in the picturesque canyon of the Truckee River fully described in another chapter.   The elevations are Sacramento, 32 feet; Auburn, 1360; Colfax, 2422; Emigrant Gap, 5225;       Cisco, 5940; Summit, 7018; Truckee, 5819; Tahoe Tavern, 6240.   FROM TAHOE TAVERN TO TALLAC   On Tuesday, June 9, 1914, I had the pleasure of making the first trip of the season over       the new Tahoe Boulevard from Tahoe to Tallac. Let me here quote the account written at the       time:   It was a fine morning, clear and just cool enough to be pleasant, no wind, sun shining       through the trees, the Lake glistening in its richest morning glory, the air like wine,       birds singing everywhere, chipmunks chattering as they ran up and down the trees, and we       as full of life as they, when we made the start. Our machine was a Chalmers 20, a       first-class chauffeur at the wheel, with instructions to go slow, let us see all there       was, and to run no risks if the winter's snows and storms had interfered with the safety       of the road. We didn't even wear overcoats, though all the peaks were covered with snow.   The first mile or two from the Tavern is through ave-   130     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   nues of second growth timber just tall enough to be delightful. In turn we passed many of       the choice residences that are making Tahoe growingly popular as a summer home, and then       crossed Ward Creek and Blackwood Creek. This latter is one of the principal trout spawning       streams of Tahoe, and to prevent fishermen from catching the fish that seek the stream at       the spawning season the Fish Commissioners have placed a buoy out in the Lake, some       twenty-five hundred feet away, within which bound it is illegal to catch fish.   While many trees have been logged from this region there are still enough to make it       forest-like, and as the road winds and turns it affords glimpses and full views, sometimes       for only a moment or two, and again for a minute or more, of the placid-faced blue Lake on       the left, or the snowy mountain summits straight ahead or on the right. What rich       contrasts of color, what revelations of majesty and sublimity each new turn affords    The first eight miles is fairly level road and close to the Lake, but eight miles out,       just before reaching McKinney's, the new portion of the State Highway begins, and it has       been engineered to give scenic and romantic effect all along the way. In road building no       longer is it necessary to consider the cheapest and nearest way.   Give us the most       scenic,  cry the motorists,   we'll pay the bills and our machines will speedily eat up       any extra distance we may be required to travel to obtain the best scenery of the       country.  From now on the whole trip is one of carefully engineered surprises and       revelations. Colwell's Moana Villa, and Pomin's new and beautiful place are passed and       then we ascend, and suddenly Meek's Bay is revealed to us, a glorious symphony in blues,       deepening and richening into pure amythest, with lines, patches and borders of emerald and       lapis lazuli. Beyond rise hill-studded slopes leading the eye higher and higher until,       anchored in a sky as blue as is the Lake below, are the   THE WISHBONE AUTOMOBILE ROUTE     131   snowy-white crowns of the Rubicon Peaks, with here and there a craggy mass protruding as       though it were a Franciscan's scalp surrounded by pure white hair. Up and down we glide,       the soft purring of the motor as we run on the level changing to the chug-chugging of the       up-pulls, or the grip of the brake as we descend. Every few feet new vistas of beauty are       projected before us. The moving pictures are all exquisite. Indeed, after many studies of       this incomparable Lake Tahoe I verily believe there is no more beautiful spot on it than       Meek's Bay seen from this road.   To get its full charm we stop the machine for a while. Looking back we discover that the       curve where we rest is a marvelous outlook point. We have ascended to a good height and       look down upon the Lake. There are light blue, emerald green, deep blue in patches and in       long irregularly shaped points. Here are Como, Maggiore, Lugano and Windermere all in one,       though as yet free from the houses and artificial gardens on the slopes. But Nature such       as this needs none of man's adornment to make it perfect.   Starting the engine again we circle around the point and come immediately into another       charming circlet of views. Between Meek's Bay and Rubicon Point is another little recess       in the lakeshore, Grecian Bay, a good second to the one I have just described. Here we       particularly notice the effect of the many varieties of trees, their dark trunks, branches       and foliage set out almost in silhouette against the pure color of the Lake below. These       elevated stretches of road are a constant joy and delight. They afford us glad surprises       every few moments in such views of the Lake as we could not otherwise obtain.   Crossing Lonely Gulch, watched over by the serene pure loveliness of the snowy peaks       above, a good climb up a steep stretch of road brings us to the shoulder of Rubicon Point.       Winding in  and out,  twining and twisting around  and   132     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   around, we reach Rubicon Park, from which place we get a perfect view of the whole Lake       from one end to the other.   To-day there are a score or more of fishermen out in their little boats, and strange to       say, all of them near enough to be seen, are fishing in a patch of deep blue. The water       there must be deeper than elsewhere, for there is where they invariably get their best       catches.   In marked contrast to the blue is a great finger of emerald thrust out from a nearby       point, as if in warning not to dare pass its mysterious border.   Now we come to the wild and rugged scenery. We are hemmed in on the right by towering       crags and walls of massive gray rock. Shattered and seamed, scarred and disintegrated,       they look as though earthquake and lightning shock and the storms of a thousand years had       battled with them. They give a new touch of grandeur and almost awesome sublimity to the       scene.   For a mile or two we play at hide and seek with the Lake. It seems as though we were in       the hands of a wizard.  Now you see it, now you don't.  Query:  Where is the Lake ?        Mountains, snowbanks, granite walls, trees galore, creeks flashing their white crests       dashing down their stony courses toward the Lake, but only now and then do we catch       fleeting glimpses of it. All at once it bursts full and clear again upon our enraptured       vision, but only to give us a full taste of its supernal beauty before we are whirled       around a curve where the eye rests upon nothing but the rugged majesty of the Sierras.       Change and contrast, the picturesque, beautiful, delicate and exquisite in close touch and       harmonious relationship with the majestic and the sublime. Travel the whole world over and       nothing surpassing this can be found.   Now we curve around high up above Emerald Bay, that small glacial Lake, the eastern       terminal moraine of which   THE WISHBONE AUTOMOBILE ROUTE     133   was unfortunately torn through, so that the lake disappeared and became a bay of the great       Lake itself. Every moment of this portion of the ride is a delight. The senses are kept       keenly alert, for not only have we the Lake, the bay and the mountains, but part of the       way we have flowers and shrubs by the thousands, bees and butterflies flit to and fro, and       singing streams come foaming white from the snowbanks above, eager to reach the Lake. As       our car-wheels dash across these streamlets they splash up the water on each side into       sparkling diamonds and on every hand come up the sweet scents of growing, living things.       Now Mt. Tal-lac, in all his serene majesty, looms ahead. Snow a hundred or more feet deep       in places covers his rocky sides. Here we can see where glaciers were born in the early       days when Tallac was several thousand feet higher than it now is.   Below us is the emerald-ringed bay, with its romantic little island at the west end, and       nearby the joyously-shouting Eagle Creek as it plunges over the precipice and makes the       foam-flecked Eagle Falls. Our road here was blasted through some fiercely solid and       hostile rock. One boulder alone that stood in the way weighed (it was estimated by the       engineers) from 800 to 1000 tons. Fifty cases of highly explosive powder were suitably       placed all around it. Excursion steamers took hundreds of people from all parts of the       Lake to see the explosion, and at the proper moment, while everybody held his breath, the       fuses were fired, the blasts took effect, the rock flew down to the level beneath,       shattered into four great masses. A new El Capitan now rises above us, though it lacks the       smooth unbroken dignity of the great Yosemite cliff, yet it is sublime in its sudden rise       and vast height. Nestling at its feet is Eagle Lake, and beyond are the Velmas and a score       of other glacial jewels calling for visitors to rhapsodize over their beauty. Maggie's       Peaks are to our right, Eagle Falls to our left, with   134     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Emerald Bay, the Island, the Point and the Lake beyond all calling upon us to enjoy them       to the full.   We decide to stay here for lunch, and under the shelter of a giant sugar pine a thousand       years old, listening to the eternally buoyant song of Eagle Falls, we refresh ourselves       with the good lunch put up for us at the Tavern.   Again we push ahead and soon have our first adventure: The road gang was at work, and we       did not expect to go much farther, but they assured us that, save for a few rough places       here and there, which they would speedily correct, we need have no fear but that we could       get through with ease. In a score of places, since we left the Tavern, we had crossed       little streams of snow-water that had come tumbling down from the banks above. Suddenly we       came to one with a larger volume than most of the others, and the road bed a little       softer, so it had cut quite a deep little passage for itself. Easily our chauffeur dropped       the front wheels into the cut, and to his surprise he found they stuck there. It did not       take us long to jack up the wheels and put rocks underneath them, and we were about ready       to get out when the road gang came along with a wagon and a pair of sturdy mules. As       quickly as it takes me to tell it the mules were attached to our back axle and we were       pulled out. A few more rocks and a couple of planks placed over the cut and we were       honking on our way with triumph.   Half a mile farther we came upon the ridge that separates Emerald Bay from Cascade Lake.       Both are in clear view at the same time, while to the west we can hear the joyous song of       Cascade Falls in its grand leap down from the foot of the snow-banks of Mt. Tallac into       the tree-clad stream-course below.   Now the road brings us almost directly above the Lake, with a rapid slope down, covered       with dainty trees and shrubs of recent growth.    From here we gain a fine view   THE WISHBONE AUTOMOBILE ROUTE     135   of the south end of the lakeshore. Tallac, the Grove, Bijou, Al Tahoe and clear across to       Lakeside, with the deep green of the meadows above, and the snowy crowns of Freel's,       Job's, and Job's sister, with Monument Peak combine to give the proper setting to the       Lake.   Soon we are racing across the level to the Fish Hatchery, between avenues of quaking       aspens and young tamaracks and pines. Suddenly we come upon a mired car, the driver of       which had just crossed the Sierras from Placerville, with little or no difficulty, but       coming to a soft piece of road here when going a trifle faster than he should, and the       side of the road having caught a lot of snow-water, he had bogged and was working like a       beaver to extricate himself. We had a stout rope along and it was the work of two or three       minutes to get him out and we again pushed forward, gratified and smiling at the warmly       expressed thanks of himself and his three happy women-folks who were enjoying their first       trip into the Tahoe country, and already confessing their complete subjection to its       thrall.   Passing the Hatchery we were only a few more minutes in reaching Tallac House, the first       to complete the auto-trip this season. Except for a few short stretches of scarcely       completed road it is in excellent condition, and the road gang now at work will have all       the rough portions smoothed down in a few days.   It should here be noted that side trips may be made in automobiles to Glen Alpine Springs       and Fallen Leaf Lodge. Both resorts use their own automobile stages daily during the       season, hence keep the roads in good condition.   We made the return trip from Tallac House to the Tavern in two hours exactly. The distance       is 26 miles. The road gang had already put a bridge over the place that had delayed us on       coming out, and the road throughout was easy and safe.    Naturally it is not as easy to       negotiate as a   THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   San Francisco boulevard, but with the wheel in the hands of a careful chauffeur there is       perfect safety and a trip that need give not a moment's fear to the most timorous.   FROM  TALLAC  TO  SACRAMENTO,   BY THE   PLACERVILLE ROUTE,   108   MILES   This is practically the first historic route into California, for, as I have shown in the       chapter on Fremont's Explorations, it was the one the Pathfinder practically followed on       his memorable trip that led to the discovery of Lake Tahoe.   Hence, when the gold excitement attracted its thousands to California, many of the       argonauts took this road, following the Humboldt River and turning south at the Humboldt         Sink,  crossing to the Carson   Sink   and then ascending to the headwaters of the Carson       River, over into Hope Valley and thence down to Strawberry Valley and on to the mines.       This was the origin of the road, and it was in steady and continuous use until the       startling news of the discovery of the Comstock Lode in Virginia City aroused the mining       world. From every camp in California rude and stalwart men eagerly set forth to reach the       new Camp. It was a genuine stampede. The chief question was:   Will the new Camp make good       ?   It answered this question by transcending the expectations of the most sanguine.       Silver and gold were taken out in fabulous quantities. Chunks of almost pure native       silver, weighing scores of pounds, were hewed out of the chambers where they were found,       and men went wild with excitement. Houses sprang up over-night. A vast population soon       clung to the slopes of Mt. Davidson. Mining and milling machinery was needed, and demanded       with tremendous urgency, to reap the richer harvest. There was no railroad, and the old       Emigrant Road was not in condition to meet the needs. Few people can realize the wild       excitement that reigned and the string of teams, men   THE WISHBONE AUTOMOBILE ROUTE      137   riding on horseback, or afoot, stage-coaches, freight wagons, that poured in endless       procession over the road. Nothing like it has been seen since, except during the Klondike       rush. As soon, however, as it was possible to secure the proper authority newer and easier       grades were surveyed and private individuals undertook to build certain sections of the       road under the condition that they were to be granted the right to collect toll for so       many years. These rights have long since lapsed, and the road is now a part of the       excellent system of El Dorado County, which, though a mountain county, boasts some of the       best roads in California.   Tallac to Echo, ny2 Miles. Leaving Tallac, an easy and pleasant eight-mile run on almost       level roads through Tallac Meadows brings one to Celios, once Myers' Station (6500 feet).       Now begins the upgrade, winding its way up the mountain side to the crest from which Starr       King wrote his exquisite description, elsewhere quoted. This is one of the superb       outlook-points where the full sweep of Lake and encircling mountains is in full and       complete view.   After a few minutes for gazing the journey is resumed, soon crossing a bridge, near which       stand the remnants of the old toll-house. On the right a foot-trail or bridle-path leads       to Glen Alpine. A few miles of fairly rapid descent and Echo is reached, 4934 miles from       Placervilie.   The stream here, during the snow-melting season must be a dashing, roaring, sparkling mass       of foam, for it is a bowlder-strewn rocky way, suggesting the wild stream it becomes when       the snows melt and spring's freshets come.   Echo to Strawberry, 7 Miles. The next mile and a half is a rapid descent, for elevation       declines five hundred feet, ere we reach Phillips, near which, in Audrian Lake, is the       chief source of the South Fork of the American River.   The Water Company that controls the flow has here tampered with primitive physiography, in       that it has cut a tunnel   138     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   or channel from the Echo Lakes, tapping their water supply and conveying it to Audrian       Lake. Hence strictly speaking the Echo Lakes are now the headwaters of the South Fork.   Soon we pass Hay Press Meadows, so called from the fact that hay was cut here in the old       stage-coach days, baled with an old-fashioned press, and sold for  90 to  100 per ton,       after being hauled to Virginia City.   Down we go into Strawberry Valley, where 42 4 miles from Placerville, we reach Strawberry,       at 5700 feet elevation. This used to be a noted stopping-place in the olden days,       sometimes the whole flat area being covered with loaded wagons bound for the mines.   There is a rugged majesty about this Valley that has always made its impression on men. To       the right is the southern end of the Crystal Range, and to the left the Yosemite-like       cliff known as Lover's Leap, 6985 feet elevation. As the station at Strawberry is 5700       feet, this cliff is 1285 feet in sheer ascent. Leading up it are strange columnar towers       and structures of Egyptian appearance that remind us of those lines of Joaquin Miller's:   Great massive rocks that near us lay, Deep nestled in the grass untrod   By aught save wild beasts of the wood       Great, massive, squared, and chisel'd stone, Like columns that had toppled down From       temple dome or tower crown,   Along some drifted, silent way   Of desolate and desert town   Built by the children of the Sun.   We pass under the great cliff, and past a glacially-polished dome on the left. The cliff       is all cross-hatched and seamed with infiltrations of quartz. Ahead of us to the right is       a canyon that is the southern extension of Desolation Valley.   THE WISHBONE AUTOMOBILE ROUTE     139   Strawberry to Kyburgs, 10 Miles. A few miles below Strawberry we pass Georgetown Junction       (where the road from Georgetown enters the main road), and ten miles brings us to Kyburgs,       4000 feet elevation, the canyon narrowing as we descend. On the right we pass Sugar Loaf       (6500 feet).   At Kyburgs the water is taken out for the domestic and irrigation water-supply of       Placerville     8000 inches of water. The station is located at a break in the mountains       where a cone-shaped rock, covered with trees, is a striking feature.   Kyburgs, Through Riverton, to Pacific House, 14 Miles. Passing the South Fork of the       American on the left, nine and a half miles brings us to Riverton, a charming river resort       where many visitors stop during the season for a day or a week, as this is a noted center       for fishing and hunting. Here we cross over an excellent bridge, surrounded by a mountain       amphitheater lined with trees, and our road follows the course of the bowlder-strewn       river-bed. Yonder is the scene of a noted   hold-up   in the old mining days.   If we cared to go over the files of the newspapers of the days when bullion was being       shipped daily by stage to Placerville, how many accounts might we not find of   hold-ups         by daring   road-agents.  And it does not take much imagination to picture in this       secluded spot or that, the sudden appearance of a masked bandit, gun in hand, and to hear       the sharp quick commands,  Halt  and Hands up   and to hear the   squeesch   of the brake       on the wheel, to see the hands of driver, express-messenger, and passengers go up in       helpless anger and furious impotence.   Then the  Stand down here   or  Come off of that quick, and line up alongside    and the       immediate obedience of all concerned, and the sharp   keep them hands up, gentle-   140     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   men, or somebody'll be gettin' hurt,  or perhaps a fierce imprecation, if the bandit was       less of the   Gentleman George   type than has so often been described.   And what a scene it would make for an artist     the most indignant passenger of them all       made to hold the hat and collect the   swag,  as the alert-eyed bandit stands by, gun in       hand, ready to shoot down the first person who makes any show of resistance    Then the permission given to get aboard, accompanied by the rude order:   Throw out that       express-box, and drive on, and don't look this way or some one'll have a hole blown       through the top of his head    and the mixture of dejection and relief shown in the faces       of driver, messenger and passengers as the coach rolled on again.   What a panorama of quickly acted scenes it must have been, and how often it occurred on       this road   Not even history has recorded a half of the times it happened.   Soon, almost hidden in the dense foliage of the tree-lined slopes, we pass Esmeralda Fall,       whose waters dash in foam over 60 feet, to unite with the river far beneath.   As we near Pacific House, 4  miles further on, we come to where the new road diverges a       little from the old one. It used to descend to the river, but we preserve a fairly even       grade, solidly built, wide and well kept.   Pacific House to Placerville, 18J/2 Miles. Then for a mile or so the road hangs over the       yawning chasm of the river. It is wide and in fine condition so we dash along to where, on       the up trip, the first glimpse is gained of the. Crystal Range, its two chief peaks,       Pyramid and Agassiz, dominating the landscape from this side as they do from Desolation       Valley on the eastern side of the range.   In nine more miles Camino is reached, through clusters of pines, with perfectly level       stretches for speeding and     dreaming.    One's mind unconsciously goes back to the old   CASINO AT TAHOE TAVERN, FROM PIER   PIER, STEAMER TAHOE, AND LAKE TAHOE FROM CASINO   THE WISHBONE AUTOMOBILE ROUTE      141   days and he sees as in a moving-picture film the   days of '49.  For this road is a road       of memories. One shuts his eyes and muses, and immediately there troops before him a       rushing, bustling, hurrying throng. These were the modern argonauts, the seekers for the       Golden Fleece:   Great horny-handed men and tall; Men blown from many a barren land   Beyond the sea; men red of hand,   And men in love, and men in debt, Like David's men in battle set     And every man somehow a       man.   They push'd the mailed wood aside,   They toss'd the forest like a toy, That grand forgotten race of men     The boldest band       that vet has been Together since the Siege of Troy.   Some carried packs on their backs, with pick and shovel, drill and pan. Others rode,       leading their burden-bearing burros or mules. Wagon after wagon creaked along, laden to       the full with supplies, food, or machinery.   As we push along and come to the river, Joaquin Miller's words make the memory pictures       for us:   I look along each gaping gorge, I hear a thousand sounding strokes   Like giants rending giant oaks,   Or brawny Vulcan at his forge; I see pickaxes flash and shine; Hear great wheels whirling       in a mine.   Here winds a thick and yellow thread,   A moss'd and silver stream instead; And trout that leap'd its riffled tide Have turn'd       upon their sides and died.   Below Camino we pass near to Pino Grande, where the great cable railway carries loaded       cars of logs across the deep canyon of the American River.   Rapidly we reach Smith's Flat, 4 miles, a famous mining-camp in the days gone by, but now       consisting of a general   i42     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   store, a few houses, and a gnarled old log fashioned into a glorious water-trough fit for       the Vikings.   Three more miles and Placerville is reached, the quaint old reminder of   the days of '49,       the days of old, the days of gold,  when men flocked to California from all parts of the       earth eager with the lust for gold. In those memorable days it was called   Hangtown,  a       name some of its present-day citizens would fain forget, oblivious, in their own       small-mindedness that they are neither responsible for its history nor its nomenclature.   Built primarily in the somewhat shut-in walls of a small canyon, it winds and curves       around in a happy-go-lucky fashion, and when the canyon widens out, spills over into       irregular streets and up and down hills that were once clad with pines, firs, spruces and       junipers. That wealth and prosperity have smiled upon it in late years is evidenced by its       comfortable lawn-girdled homes, its thriving orchards, its active business streets, and       its truly beautiful, because simple, chaste and dignified, county court-house.   Placerville to Sacramento, 47 Miles. This is a well-known road, via Diamond Springs, 2 4       miles; El Dorado, 6 miles; Shingle Springs, 11 miles, and Folsom, 25 miles.   The elevation at Tallac is 6225 feet; at Echo, 7500 feet; Strawberry, 5700 feet; Kyburgs,       4000 feet; Riverton, 3300 feet; Pacific House, 3400 feet; Sportsman's Hall, 3600 feet;       Camino, 3000 feet; Smith's Flat, 2250 feet; Placerville, 1830 feet; El Dorado, 1610 feet;       Folsom, 198 feet, and Sacramento, 32  feet.   A well equipped auto stage is run daily between Tallac House and Placerville. Experienced       and careful drivers and first class cars only are used. They are owned by the Richardson       Garage, of Pasadena, Calif., long known to the exacting population of that city as a       thoroughly reliable, prompt and efficient house.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XIV   TAHOE  TAVERN   SWINGING around to the south from the course of the Truckee River on to the Lake, the       railway deposits the traveler at Tahoe Tavern, preeminently the chief resort for those who       demand luxurious comfort in all its varied manifestations. Yet at the outset let it be       clearly understood that it is not a fashionable resort, in the sense that every one, men       and women alike, must dress in fashionable garb to be welcomed and made at home. It is a       place of common sense and rational freedom. If one comes in from a hunting or fishing trip       at dinner time, he is expected to enter the dining room as he is. If one has taken a walk       in his white flannels he is as welcome to a dance in the Casino, the dining-room, or the       social-hall as if he wore the most conventional evening dress. Indeed, visitors are urged       to bring their old clothes that they may indulge to the full their penchants for       mountain-climbing, riding, rowing, fishing, horseback-riding, botanizing in the woods, or       any other out-of-door occupation where old clothes are the only suitable ones.   The building itself is completely embowered in pine, cedar, spruce and firs of differing       ages, sizes and qualities of color. Though far enough from the Lake to allow of a large       un-trimmed grass-plot where innumerable swing seats, reclining chairs,   lazy rests,        etc., invite to lounging and loafing, the trees have been so trimmed out as to give       exquisite glimpses of the dazzling blue of the water from every hand.   143      144     THE LAKE OF THE SKY     LAKE TAHOE   The Tavern is especially appropriate to its surroundings. It is three full stories high,       with many gables relieving the regularity of the roof, which is steep-pitched, to throw       off the winter's snows. The whole structure is covered with shingles, stained or oiled to       a dark brown, and as climbing and clinging vines have wreathed themselves about every       corner, and up many posts of the veranda, and there is a wealth of cultivated wild flowers       banked up in beds around it, nothing could be more pleasing and harmonious. Roads, walks       and trails radiate from the Tavern in all directions, except directly across the Lake, and       numerous boats and launches make this as accessible as any other direction. Near enough to       be interesting is the wharf, with its daily bustle of the arrival and departure of trains,       launches and steamers.   For all the indoor sports a Casino has been erected, far enough away so that the music,       dancing, the sharp clangor of bowling, the singing of extemporized glee-clubs, and the       enthusiasm of audiences at amateur theatricals and the like do not disturb the peaceful       slumbers of those who retire early. While Tahoe Tavern itself is sui generis in that it is       the most wonderful combination of primitive simplicity with twentieth century luxury, the       Casino is even more remarkable. Its interior finish is the work of a nature artist. Its       porches immediately overlook the Lake, and when one has wearied of dancing there is a       witchery as rare and subtle as it is delightful to sit in the subdued light overlooking       the ripples of the moonlit water, sipping some liquid refreshment, eating an ice or       chatting with a suitable partner.   Here a fine orchestra discourses sweet music, moving pictures are regularly shown,       lectures and concerts occasionally provided, besides all the conveniences for private       card-parties and other pleasures that fashionable visitors expect for their entertainment.   Ruskin has somewhere brought out the idea in his finest      BALLROOM IN THE CASINO, TAHOE TAVERN   TAHOE TAVERN FROM LAKE TAHOE   PATH IN THE WOODS BY LAKE TAHOE, TAHOE TAVERN   MORNING SERVICE AT THE CHAPEL OF THE TRANSFIGURATION, TAHOE TAVERN   TAHOE TAVERN   145   phraseology that nowhere can man so readily worship God as in the presence of the most       beautiful of His works in Nature. This is readily apparent at Tahoe, hence the summer       visitors and others of religious trend will delight to learn that churches for both       Catholic and Episcopal worshipers have been erected not far from the Tavern. The Catholic       Church was dedicated Sept. 10, 1911. It has a seating capacity of a hundred and       seventy-five. Its location was chosen with an eye to the beautiful, being on Tahoe       Heights, and is less than fifteen minutes' walk from the Tavern.   The Episcopal   Church of the Transfiguration   is unique in that it is an open air       building, the altar only being roofed. Towering pines stand as aisles and the vaulted       ceiling is the clear blue dome of heaven. Rustic and simple, it harmonizes exquisitely       with its surroundings, and strangely insensible must that worshiper be who, as he kneels       in this Nature shrine, and the organ peals forth its solemn notes, with a wonderful       accompaniment of hundreds of singing birds, and the ascending incense of a thousand       flowers, does not feel his own soul lifted into a higher and more spiritual mental frame.   One of the chief troubles about a hotel like Tahoe Tavern is that it is too tempting, too       luxurious, too seductive to the senses. The cool, delicious breezes from the Lake make the       nights heavenly for sleep. With Sancho Panza we cry aloud:   Blessed be the man that       invented sleep,  and we add:   Blessed be the man that invented cool nights to sleep in.        And I have no fault to find with the full indulgence in sleep. It is good for the weary       man or woman. It is well to make up arrears, to pay oneself the accumulated debts of       insomnia and tossing and restlessness with an abundance of calm, dreamless, restful sleep.       Nay, not only would I have men claim their arrearage, but lay in a surplus stock   146     THE LAKE OF THE SKY     LAKE TAHOE   against future emergencies, future drafts upon their bank account of   restorer.    Nor would I find any fault with the allurements of the Lake, either for swimming, boating,         launching,  canoeing or fishing. Indulge them all to your heart's desire and you will       not only be none the worse, but immeasurably better for every hour of yielding. A plunge       every morning is stimulating, invigorating and jolly. It clears the brain, sets the blood       racing up and down one's spine, arms, fingers, legs and toes, and sweeps the cobwebs out       of the brain. A row is equally good. It pulls on the muscles of the lower back, as well as       the arms, chest and shoulders. It drives away Bright's disease and banishes asthma and       lung trouble. It makes one breathe deep and long and strong, and when inbreathing, one can       take in power from Tahoe's waters, forests, mountains and snow-fields. It means a       purifying of the blood, a clearing of the brain, a sending of a fuller supply of gastric       juices to the stomach, of digestive sauces to the palate, and a corresponding stimulus to       the whole body, which now responds with vim, energy, buoyancy and exuberance to all calls       made upon it by the spirit.   So with walking through the woods, by the Lake, along the River Trail, up the mountains.       The results are the same until the man who hates and despises the poets shouts out with       glee and exclaims:  Them's my sentiments   when you throw out with fervor such lines as:   Oh  the wild joys of living  the leaping from rock up to rock, The strong rending of       boughs from the fir-tree, the cool silver   shock   Of the plunge in a pool's living water. . . . How good is man's life, the mere living  how       fit to employ All the heart and the soul and the senses forever in joy    While all the conventional amusements are provided at Tahoe Tavern a large number of the       guests, like myself, find   TAHOE TAVERN   147   much pleasure in feeding and making friends with the chipmunks, which have been so       fostered and befriended that there are scores of them, most of them so fearless as to       climb into the laps, eat from the hands, run over the shoulders, and even explore the       pockets of those who bring nuts and other dainties for their delectation. Children and       adults, even gray-haired grandpas and grandmas, love these tiny morsels of animation, with       their quick, active, nervous movements, their simulations of fear and their sudden bursts       of half-timorous confidence. With big black eyes, how they squat and watch, or stand,       immovable on their hind legs, their little forepaws held as if in petition, solemnly,       seriously, steadily watch, watch, watching, until they are satisfied either that you are       all right, or are to be shunned. For, with a whisk of the tail, they either dart towards       you, or run in the other direction and hide in the brush, climb with amazing speed up a       tree, or rush into their holes in the ground.   Some of them are such babies that they cannot be many months old, and they feel the       friendly atmosphere into which they have been born. And it is an interesting sight to see       a keen, stern, active business man from   the city   saunter with his wife after lunch or       dinner, sit down on the steps leading down to the water's edge, or on a tree stump, or       squat down on his haunches anywhere on the walk, the lawn, or the veranda, fish some nuts       out of his pocket and begin to squeak with his lips to attract the chipmunks. Sometimes it       is a learned advocate of the law, or a banker, or a wine-merchant, or the manager of a       large commission-house. It seems to make no difference. The   chips   catch them all, and       every one delights in making friends with them.   Here is a tiny little chap, watching me as I loll on the stairs. His black, twinkling eye       fixes itself on me. He is making sure. Suddenly he darts toward my outstretched fingers       where a peanut is securely held.    He seizes it with   148     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   his sharp teeth, but I hold on. Then with his little paws he presses and pushes, while he       hangs on to the nut with a grip that will not be denied. If he doesn't get it all, he       succeeds in snapping off a piece and then, either darting off, with a quick whisk of his       tail, to enjoy it in his chosen seclusion, or, squatting down on his hind legs, he holds       the delicious morsel between his fore-paws and chews away with a rapidity as astonishing       as it is interesting and amusing.   Now a fat old fellow     he looks like a grandpa in age     comes up. He is equally suspicious       at first, takes his preliminary reconnaissance, darts forward and just about reaches you,       when he darts away again. Only for a moment however. On he comes, seizes the nut, and eats       it then and there, or darts off with inconceivable rapidity, up the tree trunk to a branch       twenty, forty feet up, and then sits in most cunning and cute posture, but in just as big       a hurry and in equally excitable fashion to eat his lunch as if he were within reach.   Sometimes half a .dozen or more of them, big and little, will surround you. One leaps upon       your knee, another comes into your lap, while another runs all over your back and       shoulders. Now and again two aim at the same time for the same nut, amd then, look out.       They are selfish little beggars and there is an immense amount of human nature in such       tiny creatures. The bigger one wants the morsel and chases the smaller one away, and he is       so mad about it and gets so in earnest that sometimes he chases the other fellow so far       that he forgets what it was all about. He loses the nut himself, but, anyhow, he has       prevented the other fellow from getting it.    How truly human    Then the younger one, or the smaller one, or the older one, will whisk himself up a tree,       perch on a branch and begin to scold, or he climbs to the top of a stump, or a rock,   TAHOE TAVERN   149   or merely stands upright without any foreign aid, and how he can   Chip, chip, chip, chip          His piercing little shriek makes many a stranger to his voice and ways wonder what       little bird it is that has so harsh a cry, and he keeps at it so persistently that again       you say, How human  and you wonder whether it is husband scolding wife, or wife husband,       or     any of the thousand and one persons who, because they have the power, use it as a       right to scold the other thousand and one poor creatures who have to submit, or think they       have (which is pretty much the same thing).   These proceedings at Tahoe Tavern are diversified by the presence of a friendly bluejay.       He is one of the smartest birds in the world. Some relation, no doubt, to the bird told of       by Mark Twain in his Tramp Abroad. This bluejay has watched the visitors and the chipmunks       until he has become extra wise. He has noticed that the latter toil not neither do they       spin and yet neither Solomon Levi nor Kelly feed more sumptuously or more often than do       they, simply because they have succeeded in beguiling the hearts of the guests who are so       bored with each other that association with the   lower   animals is a great relief. So he       has started the   friendly chipmunk   role. He stifles his raucous cry, he puts on a shy,       timid and yet friendly demeanor. He flies conveniently near, and gives forth a gentle       note, asking, please, your kind and favorable attention to the fact that he is a bluejay.       As soon as he sees your eye upon him, he hops a little nearer; not too near, however,       either to mislead you or to put himself in your hands, but just near enough to tempt you       to try to tempt him. You hold out a nut, and then, with a quick dart and a sharp peck with       a bill trained to certain and sure work, your thumb and finger lose that which they held,       and Mr. Bluejay is eating it in perfect security well beyond your reach.    Oh, he is a       fascinating   150     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   creature is this bunch of beautiful blue feathers decorating the harshest voice of all       birddom in the region of Lake Tahoe.   But birds, squirrels, flowers, scenery, sports, worship, fine music, the best kind of       food,   air the angel's breathe,  and sleep recuperative enough to revivify the old and       decrepit, fishing, rowing, swimming and the like are not all that need fill one's days at       Tahoe Tavern.   Hike * out, afoot or horseback. Take the trails. Get Bob Watson, or one of his       under-studies, to pilot you to Watson Peak and lake, go to Ellis, Squaw or a score of       other peaks, visit the various Sierran lakes, or take a camping out or hunting trip to       Hell Hole, the Yosemite, or any one of the scenic spots, one, two, five, or ten days away.       Then, my word for it, you will return home   a new man,  life will put on a new meaning,       and sensations long since lost will come back with unthought of force, for you will have         regained your youth      that dream of the old of all the ages.   There are a number of interesting walks, drives and automobile trips which may be taken       from the Tavern, besides the lakeshore walks which are always interesting. Indian Camp is       half a mile away; Tahoe City, a little further, and here the interesting Fremont howitzer,       to whose history I have devoted a separate chapter, may be seen; Tavern Spring, a       beautiful walk through the woods, one and a quarter miles; the Fish Hatchery, a mile away,       where all the processes of hatching various kinds of trout before they are distributed to       the different lakes and streams may be witnessed.   To those who prefer longer walks, or horseback rides,   1This word, slang or not, is finely expressive, and is already fully established in the       accepted nomenclature of mountain climbers.   TAHOE TAVERN                        151   there are the Logging Camp, three and a third miles; Idle-wyld, four miles; Stanford Rock,       five miles; Ward Peak, six miles; Blackwood Creek Dairy, six miles; Carnelian Bay, six       miles; and Twin Peaks, seven miles. Several of these interesting places can be reached       also by automobile.   An especially delightful walk or horseback ride is by the Truckee River Trail to Deer Park       Inn, six and a half miles, and thence two miles farther to Five Lakes, near which the       waters divide, one stream flowing into the Rubicon, thence into the Sacramento and out by       the Golden Gate into the Pacific Ocean; the other by Bear Creek into the Truckee River,       thence into Pyramid Lake in the heart of the Nevada desert.   Automobile trips from the Tavern are numerous, depending entirely upon the length of time       one can give to them. Chief of all is the Tahoe Boulevard trip around the Lake to Tallac,       and thence on by Lakeside and by Cave Rock to Glenbrook, a distance of fifty miles. Hobart       Lumber Mills, twenty-two miles, are well worth a visit to those who have never seen modern       methods of making lumber; Independence Lake, thirty miles, is easily reached in two hours,       and it is one of the charming spots of the High Sierras; Webber Lake, forty-three miles,       is another exquisite beauty spot, where there is an excellent Country Club House. Reno is       reached by three routes, all of them interesting, and each well worth traveling over. An       excellent trip is to leave the Tavern after breakfast, ride on the Tahoe Boulevard to       Glenbrook for lunch, then over to Carson City, where a brief visit can be made at the       Capital of the State of Nevada, the Indian School and the prehistoric foot-prints, that       for years have been the wonder of the scientists of the world. Then on to Reno, where at       the Riverside Hotel, mine host Gosse, one of the noted figures of the hotel world of the   152     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   West, will accord a hearty welcome. Next morning Pyramid Lake can be visited and the       return to the Tavern made by way of Truckee.   For those who enjoy motor-boating on the Lake excellent provision is made. The Lake Tahoe       Railway and Transportation Company own several steam and gasoline launches, with varied       capacities,    from six to two hundred and fifty passengers     full particulars of which can       always be obtained.   Fishing boats in large numbers are to be had either with or without oarsmen, together with       full equipment for fishing or hunting trips.   The Tavern stables are prepared to supply all reasonable demands for saddle-horses,       driving-teams, and pack-animals for hunting trips, and arrangements can be made for       equipment and guides for mountain trips, of any duration, from a couple of days to three       months or more. There is also a garage with first class cars and experienced chauffeurs       for hire.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XV   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION   TO nature-lovers, more or less active, the trails all around and about Lake Tahoe are a       source of perpetual surprise and delight. I know of no region in California that possesses       such a wealth of trails     not even the Yosemite or Mt. Shasta regions. The Lake is an       ever-present friend. From ridges, peaks, summits and passes, near at hand or scores of       miles away, it never fails to satisfy the eye. Again and again, when one is least       expecting it, a turn in the trail, or a few steps forward or backward on a summit ridge       brings it into sight, and its pure blue surface, now seen smooth and glossy as a mirror,       again shining in pearly brilliancy in the sun, or gently rippled by a calm morning or       evening zephyr, or tossed into white caps by a rising wind-storm, pelted with fierce rain       or hail, or glimpsed only through sudden openings in a snowstorm, at sunrise or sunset,       each with its own dazzling brilliancies     it always gives one a thrill and warming       sensation at the heart.   Then, too, the number of peaks to the summits of which trails have been cut, so that the       walker, or the horseback rider may have easy access, are many and varied. In all there are       not less than forty peaks, each of which is well worth a trip, each presenting some       feature of its own that renders its personality worth cultivating.   In this and other chapters, I present my own experiences   153   154     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   as illustrative to give the general reader an idea of what may be expected if he (or she)       is induced to try one of the chief delights of a sojourn in this scenic region.   watson's peak and lake   Leaving Tahoe Tavern, crossing the bridge to Tahoe City, the trail leaves the main road on       the left about a mile and a half further on, passing the horse pasture on the right. Near       Tahoe City is the Free Camping Ground owned by the Transportation Company. This has a mile       frontage overlooking the Lake, and scores of people habitually avail themselves of the       privilege, bringing their own outfits with them, as, at present, there are no arrangements       made for renting tents and the needed furnishings to outsiders.   The slope up which the trail now ascends with gradual rise is covered with variegated       chaparral, making a beautiful mountain carpet and cushion for the eye. To the foot and       body it is entangling and annoying, placing an effectual barrier before any but the most       strenuous, athletic and determined of men.   Now the white firs, with their white bark, and the red-barked yellow pines begin to       appear. They accompany us all the rest of the way to the peak and lake.   Soon we cross Burton Creek, a mere creek except during the snow-melting or rain-falling       time. It empties into Carnelian Bay. Burton was one of the old-timers who owned the Island       ranch near the Lake shore, and who came to the Tahoe region at the time of the Squaw       Valley mining excitement. When the   bottom fell out  of that he did a variety of things       to earn a living, one of which was to cut bunch grass from Lake Valley and bring it on       mules over the pass that bears his name, boait it across to Lakeside at the south end of       the Lake, on the Placerville and Virginia City stage-road, and there sell it to the stage       station.    Hay   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION      155   thus gathered was worth in those days from  80 to  100 per ton.   About two and a half miles from the Tavern we come to a wood road, which is followed for       half a mile. Years ago all these slopes were denuded of their valuable timber, which was         chuted   down to the Lake and then towed across to the sawmills at Glenbrook. The remnants       are now being gathered up and used as fuel for the hotel and the steamboats.   Here and there are charming little nurseries of tiny and growing yellow pines and white       fir. How sweet, fresh and beautiful they look,    the Christmas trees of the fairies. And       how glad they make the heart of the real lover of his country, to whom   conservation   is       not a fad, but an imperative necessity for the future     an obligation felt towards the       generations yet to come.   Of entirely different associations, and arousing a less agreeable chain of memories, are       the ruined log-cabins of the wood-cutter's and logger's days.    Several of these are       passed.   As we re-enter the trail, Watson's Peak, 8500 feet high, with its basaltic crown, looms       before us. At our feet is a big bed of wild sunflowers, their flaring yellow and gold       richly coloring the more somber slopes. Here I once saw a band of upwards of 2000 sheep,       herded by a Basque, one of that strange European people who seem especially adapted by       centuries of such life to be natural shepherds. Few of them speak much American, but they       all know enough, when you ask them how many sheep they have, to answer,   About sixteen       hundred.  The limit allowed on any government reserve in any one band is, I think, 1750,       and though a passing ranger may be sure there are more, he is nonplussed when, on his       making question, the owner or the shepherd shrugs his shoulders and says,   If you don't       believe me, they're there. Go and count 'em      156     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Before the officials treated some of the Basque shepherds with what seemed to be too great       severity there were numerous forest fires on the reserve. These men were generally both       self-willed and ignorant, and we passed by at this spot a clump of finely growing firs,       which had been destroyed by a fire started by a shepherd the year before.   Watson assures me that he has personally known many cases where a tree had been blown       across a trail, and the shepherd would stop his sheep, set fire to the   wind-fall  and       then leave it to burn     sometimes allowing it to smolder for months, to the infinite peril       of the forest should an arousing wind blow the fire into life and make it spread.   Fire notices, however, now are everywhere, and a few severe punishments have largely put a       stop to all carelessness on the part of shepherds, let alone their culpable neglect. There       are still campers and automobilists and others, of the so-called superior and educated       race, who need as severe lessons as some of these ignorant Basque shepherds. They knock       down the forest-service placards, throw down matches, cigar and cigarette stumps, and       often go off and leave a camp-fire burning. The time is rapidly coming when severer and       swifter penalties will be meted out to this class of culprits, for not only are their       actions against the law, but they jeopardize all property in and near to the forests, as       well as the lives, sometimes, of many innocent men, women and children, besides destroying       the value of the mountain slopes as watersheds.   As our trail winds and ascends, the rotting stumps of trees cut years ago meet the eye on       every hand, until at length, when at about 7000 feet altitude we see no more. The       indications are clear that, though the timber is abundant above this elevation, for some       reason or other cutting ceased. Careful observation reveals a possible reason for this.       From this point on up the soil is both thin and poor, and though      A TRAIL PARTY ABOUT TO LEAVE TAHOE TAVERN   ON THE TRAIL RETURNING FROM THE SUMMIT OF MT. TALLAC   PLEASURE  PARTY ON THE  WILD GOOSE,  LAKE TAHOE   LOOKING TOWARD THE CASINO, TAHOE TAVERN,   LAKE TAHOE   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION     157   the trees seem to have flourished they are, in reality, gnarled, twisted, stunted and       unfit for a good quality of lumber. Many of them are already showing signs of decay,       possibly a proof that they grew rapidly and are rotting with equal or greater speed.   At this elevation, 7000 to 8000 feet, the red fir begins to appear. It is an attractive       and ever-pleasing tree, its dark red bark soon making it a familar friend.   How remarkably a woodsman can read what would be an unintelligible jumble of facts to a       city man. Here on one trip we found a tree. Its top was smitten off and removed a distance       of forty to fifty feet. Parts of the tree were scattered for a distance of two hundred       yards. What caused it? The unobservant man would have passed it by, and the observant,       though untrained and inexperienced, would have wondered without an answer. And yet a few       minutes' observation, with the interpretation of Bob Watson, made it as clear as the       adding of two to two. The lightning had struck the tree, and shot the top off as if lifted       and carried away bodily, at the same time scattering the pieces in every direction. Then,       it had seemed to jump from this tree to another, out of the side of which it had torn a       large piece, as if, like a wild beast in angry fury, it had bitten out a giant mouthful of       something it hated. It had then jumped     where ?    There was no sign.    It simply       disappeared.   Near by we found quite a nursery of graceful, dainty and attractive young firs;   Noah's       ark trees,  I always feel like calling them, for they remind one constantly of the trees       found in the Noah's arks of childhood days, made by the Swiss during the long winter       nights in their mountain chalets, where the trees are of a similar character to those of       the Sierras.   Near to the point at which we turn to the left for Watson's Peak, and to the right for       Watson's Lake, is a delicious,   158     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   cool, clear spring, which I instinctively called,   the Spring of the Angels.  When Bob       asked the why of the name, the answer quickly came:   It is up so high and is so pure and       good.  The elevation is about 8000 feet. We take to the left.   Here also is found the mountain pine, its fine, smooth, black bark contrasting markedly       with that of the firs and pines further down. It is generally found not lower than this       elevation around Lake Tahoe.   Near by are some scattered hemlocks. This tree is found even higher than the mountain       pine, and is seldom found lower than 8000 feet. In these higher elevations one sees what a       struggle some of the trees have for mere existence. Again and again a mountain pine will       be found, a tree perhaps fifty feet high, bowed over almost to the ground. This was done       by snow. Given the slightest list from the perpendicular when the heavy, wet snow falls       upon it, it is bound slowly to be forced over. If it is a tough, strong tree it may       sustain the weight until melting time comes, when it is released. But it never becomes       upright again. On the other hand if a cold snap comes after the snow has bent it over, it       is no uncommon thing for it to snap right in two, eight, ten or more feet from the ground.   Now we stand on the summit. This peak and its attendant lake were named after my       incomparable guide, Robert Watson, and it is well that the name of so admirable a man       should be preserved in the region through which he has intelligently and kindly guided so       many interested visitors. The elevation is 8500 feet.   What a wonderful panorama is spread out before us. Close by, just across the valley in       which nestles Watson's Lake, 7900 feet elevation, is Mt. Pluto, 8500 feet, the sides of       which are covered with a dense virgin forest, thus presenting a magnificent and glorious       sight.    There is no trail   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION      159   through this forest though sheep are taken there to graze in the quiet meadows secluded on       the heights.   Further to the east and north is Mt. Rose, 10,800 feet, on which is perched the       Meteorological Observatory of the University of Nevada.    Beyond is the Washoe Range.   Even before reaching the summit we gain a fine view, through the trees, of Castle Peak,       9139 feet, while further north is Mt. Lola, 9167 feet. Close at hand is a glorious       specimen of red fir, fully four and a half feet in diameter. Below us to the west is a       patch of vivid green, known as Antone Meadows. It was named after a Switzer who lived       there years ago and whose children now own it. Not far away is Round Meadow, locally known       as Bear-Trap Meadow, for one may still find there an old bear-trap that hunters were wont       to use thirty or forty years ago. In this meadow is the cabin of the Forest Ranger, which       we shall see on the return trip.   Looking now over Lake Tahoe to the western horizon we see, over Tahoe Tavern, and a little       west of north, Needle Peak (8920 feet), to the right of which is Lyon Peak (about 9000       feet). A trifle to the south of Needle Peak is Granite Chief, followed by Squaw Peak (8960       feet), Ward Peak (8665 feet), and Twin Peak (8924 feet) the one to the right having the       appearance of a buffalo feeding.   While these peaks appear in a line, and as if belonging to the same range, a glimpse at       the map will reveal that they are some miles apart.   As we look further south, across the head of Ward and Blackwood Creek Canyons, the       mountains do not seem so high, though we discern Barker Peak (over 8000 feet).   Still further southward is Ellis Peak (8700 feet) apparently well timbered. It was named       after Jock Ellis, who, on the further side, had a dairy ranch for a while. But when he       found the cream would not rise in the colder periods of   i6o     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   the year, he gave up his dairy, and went to raising sheep. In the summer months, however,       he had no trouble in disposing of all the butter he could make, or milk and cream he cared       to sell, for he was on the road from Georgetown which passed by Rubicon Springs to       McKinney's on the Lake.   On the ridge to the left are the Rubicon Peaks (9199 feet) three of them apparently, all       closely overlooking Lake Tahoe, and leading the eye down to Sugar Pine Point, which is at       the south end of McKinney's Bay.   To the west of Rubicon Peaks is Phipps Peak (9120 feet), and a little farther back Mt.       Tallac (9185 feet), while farther to the south is Ralston Peak (about 9500 feet), at this       angle and distance appearing not unlike one of the domes of the Yosemite Valley. Near by,       to the right, is Pyramid Peak (10,020 feet), though from here it presents a very different       appearance from that it holds when viewed from Mt. Tallac. Still farther to the right is       Tell's Peak (9125 feet), apparently at the end of a richly timbered ridge. Tell was an old       Switzer who used to keep a dairy ranch on the slopes of the mountain bearing his name.   At the extreme south of Lake Tahoe stands Round Top (10,130 feet), to the left of which       are the three great peaks of the Tahoe region, Freel's (10,900 feet), Job's (10,500 feet)       and Job's Sister (10,820 feet). Freel was one of the old timers who used to have a       cattle-range on the slopes.   Then, allowing the eye to follow along the southeastern curve of the Lake up to the       mountains on the eastern side, the first great depression is the pass over which the       Placer-ville road goes down the Kingsbury grade to Genoa. At the foot of the grade, at the       entrance to the Carson Valley is Van Sickle's old place, one of the early day       stage-stations on the Placerville road.   Van Sickle was a noted character, a fearless, rude pioneer,   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION      161   but well liked and highly respected. His fame was materially enhanced when he killed Sam       Brown, one of the noted desperadoes of the Tahoe region in the days of the Virginia City       mining excitement. Tradition says that Brown was a fire-eating southerner, from Texas, a       man proud of his bad record of several murders. He was notorious in Virginia City, and       when the war broke out was one of the outspoken heralds and advocates of secession. He had       trouble with Van Sickle and had threatened to kill him on sight. Coming to the place for       this purpose he himself was killed, for Van Sickle secured a shot-gun,  laid for him,  and       shot him. A great sense of relief was felt by many people at this, what was then       considered not only a justifiable but highly laudable act, for Brown was seeking to raise       a body of men to go South and fight in the Civil War. This event had much to do with       stopping too vigorous advocacy of the claims of the South from that time on in Virginia       City and the immediate neighborhood.   The road around the Lake forks at a place originally known as Edgewood's, the branch to       the left continuing along the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe, past Round Mound and Cave Rock       to Glenbrook, where it swings over the grade to the east and over the summit, divides, one       branch going down Clear Creek Canyon, and the other down King's Canyon to Carson City. It       is thirteen and a half miles from Glenbrook to Carson by way of King's Canyon, and       automobiles use this route, while stages run regularly over the other route via Clear       Creek Canyon which is only fourteen and a quarter miles to Carson.   It was during the lumbering days at Glenbrook that the railway ran from the mills to the       summit, nine miles, carrying carloads of lumber there, which were then unloaded and shot       down the water-flume to Carson City.   Letting the eye still follow the eastern shore of Lake   i62     THE LAKE OF THE SKY     LAKE TAHOE   Tahoe completing the circuit, northward, Snow Valley Peak and Marlette Peak are reached.       Under the latter, to the southwest, is Marlette Lake, largely an artificial body over a       mile long and half a mile wide, which is the reservoir for the water supply of Virginia       City. The course of the conveying flume may distinctly be traced, for part of its       twenty-four miles of length. Both peak and lake were named after S. H. Marlette, once       Surveyor-General of Nevada, and a well-known character of the earlier mining days.   Just below Marlette Lake, almost directly facing Tahoe Tavern, are several scarrings,       running almost parallel to each other and going in the most direct fashion to Lake Tahoe.       These denote where the flume broke and the water made its own rude channels to the Lake       beneath.   From this inadequate and imperfect description it can readily be imagined what a sublime       and comprehensive view is afforded from Watson's Peak. Every visitor to Tahoe should take       the trip, especially those who stay for a few days or longer at Tahoe Tavern.   WATSON   LAKE   About half a mile northwest from the summit of Watson Peak is Watson Lake, 7900 feet. It       is about 300 yards long by 250 yards broad, hence rudely oval in shape. While about fifty       feet deep in the center, it shallows toward the edges, where lilies abound, and then       becomes mere marsh. Practically it is surrounded by trees. Restocked with a variety of       fish (trout) in large numbers each year, it is one of the best fishing lakes at the       northern end of Lake Tahoe, and a most enjoyable day to the angler is to start early, take       his lunch along, and spend the day there.   To those who are not anglers this same day can be spent in the quiet enjoyment of the       trees, flowers, lake and sky.   The outlet from the lake is by Deer Creek, and thence   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION      163   into the Truckee not far from the site of the old mining-camp of Knoxville.   The return trip to Tahoe Tavern is made through a virgin forest, on a ridge between Watson       Lake and the Truckee Valley, the trail having been outlined only about five years ago.       Later the Forest Rangers considerably improved it, until now it is a very easy and       comfortable trail to traverse. One notices here the especial   blaze   on the trees, of       the rangers. It consists of a perpendicular parallelogram with a square above, thus   Wherever this blaze is found everybody in the region knows it for a ranger's blaze,       denoting a trail leading to a ranger's cabin.   On this ride one has a wonderful illustration of the popular fallacy in woodcraft that       moss is always found on the north side of the trees. Here the moss is mainly on the west.       The fact is the moss is generally found on the side from which the rain-storms come, and       here they are mainly from the south and southwest. A mile or so away on the trail to       Watson's Lake the moss is all on the southwest side of the trees.   Most of the trees here are red fir and mountain pine, some of them being of large size,       and noble specimens.   A little further on a fine opening reveals Deer Creek, through which the waters of Watson       Lake flow to the Truckee.    It was nearing the hour of sunset when I reached   164     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   this point, and the trees were glowing with flaming gold, reminding one of the pictures       John Enneking, the wonderful Boston artist, so loves to paint, while below the water       gleamed like dazzling diamonds.   Along here the side of the ridge below the trail seemed as if plowed into a number of       rudely parallel lines. These were sheep-trails made as the sheep followed each other over       the softer soil of the mountain side.   A mile and a half from Watson Lake we came to a telephone box. This was the signal box of       the Forest Rangers connecting with Lake Tahoe, five miles away, Truckee, eight miles,       Shaffer's Mills, five miles and thence to Brockway, six miles. In the direction we were       going it was but one mile to the ranger's log-cabin in Round Meadow.   In the winter time the ranger often finds it difficult to keep the line in operation. The       damp snow falling upon the wire, clings to it, freezes and keeps receiving additions until       it is bigger than a man's arm, and the weight breaks it down.   As we rode along we saw a fat porcupine, weighing full twenty-five pounds and deliberately       walking up the slope near by, as if going to its den in the rocks, but, though we yelled       and shouted, it scorned to notice us and indifferently went its way. A horned owl now and       then hooted and bade us begone, while a badger came out from his hole, but hurried back       when he saw or smelled who we were.   Now and again we caught marvelous sunset reflections on Lake Tahoe through the trees, and       on the eastern mountains was a peach glow more soft and beautiful than the famous Alpen       glow.   Soon the sun was gone, and then, as we rode through the dark aisles of the trees the stars       came out and shone with dazzling splendor overhead.    Just as we left the ranger's   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION      165   cabin a long dark corridor of majestic trees framed in a patch of black velvet in the       upper sky, and there, in the very center, shining in resplendent glory, was Venus, the       evening star.   The wind began to blow a regular cyclone from the north, so the roaring of the trees told       us, but we were largely sheltered, and as we looked up through the dancing and whirling       tree-tops there was not a cloud in the sky.   Thus we returned to the Tavern, dramatically and gloriously bringing our delightful and       easy trip to an end.   I have been rather prolix, and have entered much more fully into detail than some may deem       necessary in the account of this trip, for two important reasons. It is a trip that none       should fail to take, and I have made it a sort of general account, giving in broad outline       what the visitor may expect of any of the peak trips in the vicinity of Tahoe Tavern. It       goes without saying that, constantly, from a score or more outlook points, the eye finds       its resting place upon Lake Tahoe, each view being different and more charming than the       one that preceeded it.   TO  SQUAW  VALLEY,   GRANITE   CHIEF   PEAK,   FIVE LAKES  AND DEER   PARK  SPRINGS   Leaving Tahoe Tavern we cross the Truckee River and ride down on the north side. The       flowing Truckee is placid and smooth, save where eager trout jump and splash. The meadows       are richly green and the mountain slope on the further side is radiant with virgin       tree-life in joyous exuberance. Jays are harshly calling, chipmunks are excitedly running,       the pure blue of the sky over-arches all, the wine of the morning is in the air, and we       are glad we are alive. A spring of pure cold water on the right, about a mile out, tempts       us to a delicious morning draught.   A little further down is   Pap.  Church's   Devil's Play-   166     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   ground,    Devil's Post,  and devil's this, that and the other, out of which he gained       considerable satisfaction while driving stage-coach between Truckee and Tahoe in the days       before the railroad.   It is well carefully to observe these singular lava pudding-stone masses, for, according       to the theory of John Le Conte, the eminent physicist, recounted in another chapter, these       were the restraining masses that made the Lake at one time eighty or a hundred feet higher       than it is to-day.   Four miles from the Tavern we pass Engineer Von Schmidt's old dam, for the history of       which see the chapter on   The Truckee River.    Near Deer Park Station is another spring on the right. In the old stage days   Pap.        Church always stopped here and gave his passengers the opportunity to drink of the water,       while he made discourse as to its remarkable coldness. Five years ago a land slide       completely buried it, and the road had to be cut through again. Ever since the spring has       been partially clogged .and does not flow freely, but it is cold enough to make one's       teeth ache.   In the winter of 1881-2 a land-and-snow-slide occurred a little beyond Deer Park Station.       Watson was carrying the mail on snow-shoes at the time and saw it. There had been a five       foot fall of snow in early March, and a week or two later came a second fall of seven       feet. Something started the mass, and down it came, rushing completely across the river       and damming it up, high on the other side, and the course of the slide can clearly be seen       to-day. It is now, however, almost covered with recent growth of chaparral, and thus       contributed to one of the most beautiful effects of light and shade I ever saw. The       mountain slope on one side was completely covered with a growth of perfect trees. Through       these came pencillings of light from the rising sun, casting alternate rulings of light       and shadow in parallel lines on   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION      167   the glossy surface of the chaparral beyond. The effect was enhanced by the fleecy and       sunshiny clouds floating in the cobalt blue above.   Near the mouth of Bear Creek the river makes a slight curve and also a drop at the same       time, and the road, making a slight rise, presents the view of a beautiful stretch of       roaring and foaming cascades. Here the canyon walls are of bare, rocky ridges, of white       and red barrenness, with occasional patches of timber, but very different from the       tree-clad slopes that we have enjoyed hitherto all the way down from the Tavern.   Beyond is a little grove of quaking aspens. Their leaves, quivering in the morning breeze,       attract the eye. Crossing the railway, the road makes a climb up a hill that at one time       may have formed a natural dam across the river. Here is a scarred tree on the left where       Handsome Jack ran his stage off the bank in 1875, breaking his leg and seriously injuring       his passengers.   Crossing the next bridge to the left at the mouth of Squaw Creek, six miles from the       Tavern, on a small flat by the side of the river is the site of the town of Claraville,       one of the reminders of the Squaw Valley mining excitement.   Just below this bridge is an old log chute, and a dam in the river. This dam backed up the       water and made a   cushion   into which the logs came dashing and splashing, down from the       mountain heights above. They were then floated down the river to the sawmill at Truckee.   At Knoxville we forded the river at a point where a giant split bowlder made a tunnel and       the water dashed through with roaring speed. Retracing our steps for a mile or so we came       to the Wigwam Inn, a wayside resort and store just at the entrance to Squaw Valley. To the       right flows Squaw Creek, alongside of which is the bed of the logging railway belonging to       the Truckee Lumber Co.    It was aban-   168     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   doned two or three years ago, when all the available logs of the region had been cut. Most       of the timber-land between Squaw Creek and Truckee, on both sides of the river, was       purchased years ago, from its locators, by the Truckee Lumber Company. But Scott Bros,       purchased a hundred and sixty acres from the locators and established a dairy in Squaw       Valley, supplying the logging-camps with milk and butter for many years past.   For forty years or more this region has been the scene of active logging, the work having       begun under the direction of Messrs. Bricknell and Kinger, of Forest Hill. The present       president of the Truckee Lumber Co. is Mr. Hazlett, who married the daughter of Kinger.       This company, after the railway removed from Glenbrook and was established between Tahoe       and Truckee, lumbered along the west side of Tahoe as far as Ward Creek.   Entering the valley we find it free from willows, open and clear. The upper end is       surrounded, amphitheater fashion, by majestic mountains, rising to a height of upwards of       9000 feet. Clothed with sage-brush at the lower end and rich grass further up, even to the       very base of the mountains, it is, in some respects, the prettiest valley in the whole of       this part of the Sierra Nevadas.   The upper meadows are full of milk cows, quietly grazing or lying down and chewing their       cuds, while just beyond the great dairy buildings is the unpretentious cottage of the       Forest Ranger. Remnants of old log chutes remind one of the logging activities that used       to be carried on here.   One of the most observable features of Squaw Valley is its level character. This is       discussed in the chapter on glacial action.   On the right the vein of quartz which out-crops at Knox-ville is visible in several places       and the various dump-piles   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION      169   show how many claimants worked on their locations in the hope of finding profitable ore.   Half way up the valley is an Iron Spring, the oxydization from which has gathered together       a large amount of red which the Indians still prize highly and use for face paint.   How these suggestions excite the imagination     old logging chutes, mining-claims and       Indians. Once this valley rang with the clang of chains on driven oxen, the sharp stroke       of the ax as it bit into the heart of the tree, the crash of the giant trees as they fell,       the rude snarl of the saw as it cut them up into logs, the shout of the driver as he drove       his horses alongside the chute and hurried the logs down to the river, the quick blast of       the imprisoned powder, the falling of shattered rocks, the emptying of the ore or       waste-bucket upon the dump     all these sounds once echoed to and from these hillsides and       mountain slopes.   Now everything is as quiet and placid as a New England pastoral scene, and only the       towering mountains, snow-clad even as late as this in the fall, suggest that we are in the       far-away wilds of the great West.   But Squaw Valley had another epoch, which it was hoped would materially and forever       destroy its quiet and pastoral character. In the earlier days of the California gold       excitement the main road from Truckee and Donner Lake went into Nevada County and thus on       to Sacramento. In 1862 the supervisors of Placer County, urged on by the merchants, sent       up a gang of men from Placerville to build a road from Squaw Valley, into the Little       American Valley, down the Forest Hill Divide, thus hoping to bring the emigrant travel to       Forest Hill, Michigan Bluff, and other parts of Placer County.   It was also argued that emigrants would be glad to take this new road as all the pasture       along the other road was   170     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE     eaten off.     Over this historic road we are now about to ride.   As we look up it is a forbidding prospect. Only brave men and sanguine would ever have       dared to contemplate such a plan. The mountain cliffs, separated and split, arise before       us as impassable barriers. Yet one branch of the old trail used to pass through the divide       to the right, over to Hopkins Springs, while the one that was converted into the wagon       road took the left-hand canyon to the main divide.   We now begin to ascend this road at the head of Squaw Valley, and in five minutes, or       less, are able to decide why it was never a success. The grade is frightful, and for an       hour or more we go slowly up it, stopping every few yards to give our horses breath. All       the way along we can trace the blazes on the trees made over sixty years ago. It is hard       enough for horses to go up this grade, but to pull heavily-ladened wagons     it seems       impossible that even those giant-hearted men, used to seeing so many impossible things       accomplished, could ever have believed that such a road could be feasible. What wonderful,       marvelous, undaunted characters they must have been, men with wills of inflexible steel,       to overcome such obstacles and dare such hardships. Yet there were compensations. Squaw       Creek's clear, pellucid, snow-fed stream runs purling, babbling or roaring and foaming by       to the right. These pioneers with their women and children had crossed the sandy, alkali       and waterless deserts. For days and weeks they had not had water enough to keep their       faces clean, to wash the sand from their eyes. Now, though they had come to a land of       apparently unscalable mountains and impassable rock-barriers, they had grass for the       stock, and water,    delicious, fresh, pure, refreshing water for themselves. I can imagine       that when they reached here they felt it was a new paradise, and that God was especially       smiling upon them, and to such men,   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION      171   with such feelings, what could daunt, what prevent, what long stay their onward march.   As we ascend, the mountains on our right assume the form of artificial parapets of almost       white rock, outlined against the bluest of blue skies. There is one gray peak ahead,       tinged with green. The trail is all washed away and our horses stumble and slide, slip and       almost fall over the barren and rough rocks, and the scattered bowlders, a devastating       cloud-burst could not wash away.   Here is a spring on the left, hidden in a grove of alders and willows, and now new and       more fantastic spires arise on the right. Higher up we see where those sturdy       road-builders rolled giant rocks out of their way to make an impassable road look as if it       could be traversed.   Reaching the point at the foot of Squaw Peak at last we look back over Squaw Valley. In       the late summer tints it is beautiful, but what must it be in the full flush of its summer       glory and perfection? Then it must be a delight to the eye and a refreshment to the soul.       How interesting, too, it is to rehabilitate it as a great glacial lake. One can see its       pellucid waters of clear amethystine blue and imagine the scenes that transpired when the       ancestors of the present Indians fished, in rude dugouts, or on logs, or extemporized       rafts, upon its surface. Now it is covered with brown, yellowish grass, with tree-clad       slopes rising from the marge.   Turning to the right we find ourselves in a country of massive bowlders. They seem to have       been broken off from the summits above and arrested here for future ages and movements to       change or pass on.   The road grows severer than ever, and we cannot help again picturing those old heroes       driving their wagons up, while the women and children toiled painfully on foot up the        steep  and   rocky  slopes.    Could  anything  ever  daunt   172     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   them after this? any obstacle, however insurmountable, discourage them? any labor, however       severe, compel them to turn back?   Though there is a deep pathos in all these memories, the heroism of it makes our blood       tingle with pride that such men and women belonged to us, that we are privileged to live       in the land their labors, loves and lives have sanctified.   We turn to the right; a tiny waterfall, which in the season must be quite a sight,       trickles down near by; we are now advancing directly upon the serrated ridge of fantastic       spires that have long accompanied us. We now find those white-seeming pinnacles are of       delicate pinks, creams, blues, slates and grays. In one place, however, it seems for all       the world as if there were a miniature Gothic chapel built of dark, brownish-black lava.       Another small patch of the same color and material, lower down, presents a gable end, with       windows, reminding us of the popular picture of Melrose Abbey in the moonlight.   Now we are lined on either side by removed bowlders, but the road  ah the road  who could       ever have traveled over it? Trees twenty feet high have now grown up in the roadway. To       the left Squaw Peak (8960 feet) towers above us, while we make the last great pull through       the rocky portion ere we come to the easier rise to the shoulders of Granite Chief. Here       the road was graded out from the side of a granite mountain, blasted out and built up, but       it is now sadly washed out. Further up, a broad porphyritic dyke crosses our path, then       more trees, and we come to the gentle slope of a kind of granitic sand which composes the       open space leading to the pass between Granite Chief on the right, and a peculiar       battlemented rock, locally known as Fort Sumpter, on the left. This was named by the Squaw       Valley stampeders who came over the trail in the   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION      173   early days of the Civil War, when all patriots and others were excited to the core at the       news that Fort Sumpter had been fired upon. On one of the highest points stands a juniper       on which a big blaze was cut by the early road-makers, so that there need be no doubt as       to which way the road turned. Other nearby trees, in their wild rugged-ness and sturdy       growth, remind us of a woman whose skirts are blown about by a fierce wind. Their       appearance speaks of storms braved, battles of wind and snow and ice and cold fought and       won, for they have neither branch nor leaf on the exposed side, and on the other are       pitiably scant.   As we cross the sandy divide, over which a wagon could drive anywhere, we find white sage       in abundance. Expansive vistas loom before us, ahead and to the right, while Squaw Peak       now presents the appearance of a vast sky-line crater. We seem to be standing on the       inside of it, but on the side where the wall has disappeared. Across, the peak has a       circular, palisaded appearance, and the lower peaks to the right seem as if they were the       continuation of the wall, making a vast crater several miles in diameter. The plateau upon       which we stand seems as if it might have been a level spot almost near the center of the       bowl. Fort Sumpter is a part of this great crater-like wall and Granite Chief is the end       of the ridge.   As a rule there is a giant bank of snow on the saddle over which the trail goes between       Ft. Sumpter and Granite Chief, but this year (1913) it has totally disappeared. It has       been the driest season known for many years.   Looking back towards the Lake a glorious and expansive view is presented. Watson Peak, Mt.       Rose, Marlette Peak, Glenbrook and the pass behind it, are all in sight and the Lake       glistening in pearly brilliancy below.   At the end of the Squaw Peak ridge, on the right, is a   174     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   mass of andesite, looking like rude cordwood, and just above is a mass of breccia very       similar to that found in the Truckee Valley a few miles below Tahoe Tavern.   Below' us, at the head of Squaw Creek is a small blue pond, scarcely large and important       enough to be called a lake, yet a distinctive feature and one that would be highly prized       in a less-favored landscape.   On the very summit of the ridge we get fine views of Mounts Ralston, Richardson, Pyramid       Peak and the whole Rock Bound Range, while close at hand to the north is Needle Peak (8920       feet), and to the south, Mt. Mildred (8400 feet). To our left is Fort Sumpter, to the       right the Granite Chief, and between the two a stiff breeze is blowing.   Have you ever stood on a mountain ridge or divide when a fierce gale was blowing, so that       you were unable to walk without staggering, and where it was hard to get your breath, much       less speak, and where it seemed as if Nature herself had set herself the purpose of       cleansing you through and through with her sweetening pneumatic processes? If not, you       have missed one of the blessed influences of life.   Rough? harsh? severe? Of course, but what of that, compared with the blessings that       result. It is things like that that teach one to love Nature. Read John Muir's account           in his Mountains of California     and see how he reveled in wind-storms, and even climbed       into a tree and clung to its top   like a bobolink on a reed   in order to enjoy a storm       to the full.   Immediately at our feet lie the various mazes of canyons and ravines that make the diverse       forks of the American River. In one place is a forbidding El Capitan, while in another we       can clearly follow for miles the Royal Gorge of   this   many   branched   Sierran         river.    To   the   right   is   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION      175   Castle Peak (9139 feet) to the north and west of Donner Lake, while nearby is Tinker's       Knob (9020 feet) leading the eye down to Hopkins' Soda Springs. Beyond is Donner Peak       (8135 feet) pointing out the location of Summit Valley, just to the left (west) where the       trains of the Southern Pacific send up their smoke-puffs and clouds into the air.   At our feet is the Little American Valley, in which is the road, up the eastern portion of       which we have so toilsomely climbed. With a little pointing out it is possible to follow       the route it followed on the balance of its steep and perilous way. Crossing the valley       beneath it zigzagged over the bluff to the right, through the timber to the ridge between       the North and Middle Forks, then down, down, by Last Chance to Michigan Bluff. The       reverent man instinctively thanks God that he is not compelled to drive a wagon,       containing his household goods, as well as his wife and children, over such roads       nowadays.   Just before making the descent we succeed in getting a suggestive glimpse of what is       finely revealed on a clear day. Slightly to the south of west is Mount Diablo, while       northwards the Marysville Buttes, Lassen's rugged butte, and even stately Mt. Shasta are       in distinct sight. At this time the atmosphere is smoky with forest fires and the burning       of the tules in the Sacramento and other interior valleys, hence our view is not a clear       one.   It did not take us long to reach the old stage-station in the Little American Valley. Here       Greek George     he was never known by any other name     had a station, only the charred logs       remaining to tell of some irreverent sheep-herder or Indian who had no regard for historic       landmarks. The pile of rocks which remain denote the presence of the chimney. When the new       stage-road was built and travel over this road     always very slim and precarious     com-   176     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   pletely declined, Greek George removed, but his log hotel and bunk-house remained until a       few years ago.   We lunch by the side of the old chimney and ruminate over the scenes that may have       transpired here in those early days.   On our way back we pass the stumps of two large firs which were undoubtedly cut down to       supply George's houses with shakes. At the base of Ft. Sumpter we leave the trail down       which we have come, with the intention of going     without a trail     down Whisky Creek,       over several interesting meadows to Five Lake Creek, and thence up by the Five Lakes, over       the pass into Bear Creek Canyon, past Deer Park to the Truckee River and thus to the       Tavern.   With such an excellent guide as Bob Watson we have no hesitation in striking out in any       direction and in a short time Mt. Mildred  (8400 feet)  is on our right.   Great groves of willows and alders cover immense areas of the canyon's sides, while we       pass a giant red fir with a diameter of fully six feet.   When about half a mile from Five Lake Creek the largest portion of the canyon is taken up       with irregular masses of granite over which a glacier, or glaciers, have moved. The       striation and markings are down the valley, and looking up from below the canyon for a       mile or more it has the appearance of a series of irregular giant steps, each step       gradually sloping back to the step above. From above the course of the glacier seems       clear. It must have flowed downwards, polishing and smoothing each step in turn, then       falling over the twenty, thirty or fifty feet high edge to the next lower level, to ascend       the next slope, reach the next precipice, and so on.   At the point where we strike Five Lake Creek, in a large expanse of meadow, we pass a       camp, where in the distance   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION      177   we can clearly see three men and a woman. Deer hunters probably.    We  give them a cheery       Halloo  and pass on.   Five Lake Creek here makes a sharp bend into the canyon which is a continuation of the       canyon down which we have been traveling, and enters the Rubicon River at Hell Hole. We,       however, turn up the Creek to the northeast, here striking the regular Hell Hole trail       built a few years ago by Miss Katherine Chandler, of Deer Park. Just ahead of us,       appearing through a grove of trees near to where the Five Lakes are nestling, is a       perfectly white cloud, absolutely startling in the vividness of its contrast to the deep       blue of the sky and the equally deep green of the firs and pines.   A wilderness of bowlders compels the winding about of the trail, but we hear and see Five       Lake Creek, roaring and dashing along, for it has a large flow of water and its course is       steep and rocky. We pass through groups of willows, wild currants and alders, enter a       sparsely wooded meadow and in a few moments see the first of the Five Lakes. There is but       little difference in their levels, though their sizes vary considerably. The first one is       the largest. Here is a log cabin and two or three boats. These are owned by the Deer Park       Springs resort, and are for their fishing and hunting patrons. They also own a hundred and       sixty acres here, which include the area of the lake. The two first or lower lakes are the       largest and the deepest. It is their flow which makes Five Lakes Creek. The three upper       lakes are smaller and shallower. It is said that a divide used to separate the two lower       from the three upper lakes, and the flow from the latter descended through Bear Creek,       past Deer Park, into the Truckee River and thence into far-away Pyramid Lake in Nevada.   From this point the trail is clear and well defined, being traveled constantly during the       season by guests of Deer   178     THE LAKE OF THE SKY     LAKE TAHOE   Park Springs. Passing through a fine nursery of beautiful and exquisite red firs we drop       into the canyon of Bear Creek. To the left are great andesite crowns on the mountain tops.       Here also are more glacially polished masses and cliffs of granite, clearly indicating       great glacial activity in the upper part of this canyon. The trail is ticklish in a few       places, with steps up and down which our horses take gingerly, but nothing which need       excite an extra heart-beat to one used to mountain trails.   In less than half an hour we are at Deer Park Springs, drinking its pleasant waters, and       while we still have six and a half miles to go to the Tavern it is over easy and ordinary       road, and therefore our pleasant trip is practically at an end.   TO  ELLIS   PEAK   Homewood is the natural starting point for Ellis Peak (8745 feet) as the trail practically       leaves the Lake highroad at that point, and strikes directly upon the mountain slope.       Hundreds make the trip on foot and it is by no means an arduous task, but many prefer to       go horse-back or burro-back. In its upward beginnings the trail follows the course of an       old logging chute for a distance of some two miles, the lake terminus of which is now       buried in a nursery of white fir and masses of white lilac. There are a few cedars and       pines left untouched by the logger's ax, but they are not prime lumber trees, or not one       of them would now be standing.   To the right is Dick Madden Creek, which, like all the streams on the eastern slopes of       the great western escarpment of Lake Tahoe, comes dashing and roaring down steep and rocky       beds to the Lake.   When at about 7000 feet we find few other than red firs and mountain pines. Here is a       wonderful nursery of them that have secured a firm hold upon life.   Through-   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION      179   out the whole region the year 1913 seems to have been a most kindly one for the untended,       uncared for baby-trees. There has been comparatively little snowfall for three successive       years, and this has given the young trees a chance. As soon as their heads appear above       the snow and they are not battered down by storm they can make their way, but if the heavy       snow falls and remains upon them too long, they are either smothered, or so broken down,       that life becomes a fearful struggle and scores of them succumb. Yet in spite of this fact       hemlocks and red firs seem to prefer the north or shady slopes of the mountains and       invariably thrive much better there than where there is sunnier exposure.   When about three miles up from the Lake we reach a richly-grassed meadow, about five acres       in extent, confined in a bowl-shaped rim, broken down at the east side, through which a       rivulet, which flows across the meadow, finds outlet. This is undoubtedly one of the many       mountain lakes of the region, too shallow and with too sluggish a flow of water into it to       clear itself of the detritus washed down from the disintegrating slopes above, hence it       ultimately filled up and entered upon a new life as a meadow.   On the upper side of the meadow the trail passes through a glorious grove of hemlocks, the       clean and clear   floor   of which leads one to the observation that hemlocks generally       seem to be hostile to other and lesser growth coming in to occupy the ground with them.   Sierran heather of purple color now appears here and there in patches and we find       quantities of it further along. There are also several peculiar puff-balls, and close by a       remarkable fungus-growth like a cauliflower, fully a foot in diameter.   Nearing the summit we come to another meadow followed by another grove, where scarcely any       trees but hem-   180     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   locks are to be seen. Here also we see great beds of the California primrose which grows       with a straight upright stem crowned with blood-red or deep scarlet flowers above a rich       cluster of leaves. These flowers generally can be found blooming quite late in the season,       following the snowline as the summer's sun makes it climb higher each day. When the       winter's snows have been extra heavy the plants are covered and no flowers appear, as the       snow melts too late, but when there is a lesser amount they bloom as freely as ever,       apparently none the worse for their dormant period.   Over the peak billowy white clouds are tossing, like giant cradles built of the daintiest       and most silvery cloud-stuff to be found in the heavens for the rocking of the       cloud-babies to sleep.   On a sister peak to Ellis Peak, just to the south, is to be seen a remarkable and       strikingly picturesque cluster of hemlocks. It is almost circular in form, with eight       trees in the center, and twenty-three on the outer rim, which is over a hundred feet in       circumference. Seldom does one see so interesting a group of trees anywhere, even when       planted, and these, of course, are of native growth.   The summit itself is of broken and shattered granite, which has allowed a scraggly       mountain pine to take root and grow close to the U. S. Geological Survey monument. A       fierce gale was blowing from the west, and turning toward the tree-clad slopes of the       east, we stood in the wind, with the everlasting blue above and the glorious and       never-failing green beneath. Unconsciously there sprang to my lips Joaquin Miller's lines:   And ever and ever His boundless blue, And ever and ever His green, green sod, And ever and       ever between the two Walk the wonderful winds of God.   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION     181   Braving the wind and looking over the steep precipice to the west we see, some four       hundred or five hundred feet below us, so that it seems that we might almost throw a stone       into it, a small lake. This is Bessie Lake, named after Mrs. C. F. Kohl, of Idlewyld. It       discharges its surplus waters into Blackwood Creek, and has several times been stocked       with fish. In the mid-distance is Loon Lake, which is the head-waters of the California       Ditch, which follows over the Georgetown Divide, carries water some forty to fifty miles,       and is distributed by its owners, the Reno Water and Electric Power Co., for mining,       irrigation and domestic purposes.   East of Loon Lake are Spider and Pleasant Lakes, all of which we are told are connected       with one another and controlled by the same company. Another lake, Bixly or Bixby,       slightly to the north of Pleasant, is also connected.   To the east of Pleasant Lake, Buck Island and Rock Bound Lakes were dazzlingly brilliant       in the mid-day sun.   One has but to look at the map to realize what a comprehensive survey is possible in every       direction from Ellis Peak. There is no wonder that it is so popular. The panorama is       unobstructed     the outlook practically complete and perfect. Though the whole of the Lake       is not revealed, there is sufficient of it to make a transcendent picture. Every peak to       the north and on the eastern side is in sight, while the Tallac range, and the near-by       mountains make one long for an aeroplane that he might step from peak to peak without the       effort of journeying by land to their elevated summits.   On the left side of Tinker's Knob is a peak, unmarked on the map, to which the name of       Lion Peak has been given, for the following reason: Some years ago former Governor       Stanford's nephew, who has been a visitor for many years   i82     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   at Hopkins' Spring, was climbing, together with a companion, over this peak, when they       came to a cave. Lighting a rude torch they thoughtlessly entered it and had barely got       well inside before they saw the two fierce eyes of a mountain lion glaring at them.       Surprised and startled, they were about to turn and run, when the astonished animal sprang       past them and disappeared before they recollected they had a gun.   It should not be overlooked that Ellis Peak is the most eastern mountain of the Sierran       divide. East, its drainage empties into Lake Tahoe and thus eastward into the Big Basin;       west, into the Rubicon, thence to the American, the Sacramento and finally out by the       Golden Gate to the Pacific.   To the west of the Rubicon Peaks is a chain of lakes in the valley below known as the Rock       Bound Lakes. There are nine of these in all, though several of them are practically       unknown except to the few guides and the sheep-men who range over the surrounding       mountains.   As far as the eye can see, westward, there are distinct glacial markings, a wonderful       revelation of the widespread and far-reaching activity of these glaciers borne on the       highest crests of the Sierras. The canyon in which the Rubicon River flows is definitely       outlined, as is also the deep chasm known as Hell Hole. Near by is Bear Lake, about the       same size and appearance as Watson Lake, its overflow emptying into the Rubicon.   Close at hand to the north and west are Barker's Peak, Barker's Pass, and Barker's Creek,       and these decide us to go home by way of Barker's Pass instead of the way we came.       Accordingly we drop down, returning a short distance to the south, over the western slope       of Ellis Peak to Ellis Valley. Both peak and valley receive their name from Jock Ellis, a       Squaw Valley stay-behind, who entered the   TRAIL TRIPS IN THE TAHOE REGION      183   cattle and sheep business, and pastured his animals in this rich and well-watered region.   On our way we pass through the most remarkable white fir nursery we have yet seen. Not far       away were a few hoary monarchs from the still hanging but burst open cones of which winged       seeds were flying before the breeze. These potential firs were carried in many cases over       a mile before they found lodgement. It was a beautiful and delightful demonstration of       Nature's lavish method of preserving this useful species of tree alive.   Sweeping now to the north and east we make a rapid descent of some six hundred or seven       hundred feet to Barker's Pass, the elevation of which is about 7000 to 7500 feet, the       nearby Peak having an elevation of about 8500 feet. It is a round, bare mountain, and       seems as if it ought to be marked higher (on the map)  than it is.   Rapidly dropping we come to a peculiar mass of stratified rock, acutely tilted, unlike any       found elsewhere in the region except on Five Lake Creek on the way to Hell Hole. Just       before reaching Blackwood's Creek the trail passes through rude piles of breccia similar       to that of the Devil's Playground near the Truckee River. It may be perfectly possible       that one of the volcanic flows that covered large portions of the High Sierras, after the       Cretaceous degradations had taken place, came from a vent, or volcano, near by, and slowly       flowed down Blackwood Creek, leaving vast masses behind which have rapidly disintegrated       until these are all that remain.   These conjectures occupy our brain until we reach the Lake again, alongside of which the       road soon brings us back to our starting point, after another most enjoyable, instructive,       healthful and delightful day.   The foregoing are but samples of a hundred similar trail trips that can be taken from       every part of the Lake, and   184     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   from all the resorts. Each place has its chosen trips, and though, of course, there are       many points of similarity, there are enough individualities to make each trip distinctive.   My friends often ask me what food and drink I take along on such hiking or riding trips.       Generally the hotel provides a luncheon, but personally, I prefer a few Grant's crackers       (a thick, hard cracker full of sweet nutriment, made at Berkeley, Calif.), a handful of       shelled nuts     walnuts, peccans, or almonds, a small bottle of Horlick's Malted Milk       tablets, a few slabs of Ghirardelli's milk chocolate, and an apple or an orange. On this       food I can ride or walk days at a time, without anything else. Grant's crackers, Horlick's       Malted Milk tablets, and Ghirardelli's chocolate are the best of their kind, and all are       nutritious to the full, as well as delicious to the taste. For drink I find Horlick's       Malted Milk the most comforting and invigorating, and it has none of the after         letting-down  effects that accompany coffee drinking.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XVI   CAMPING-OUT TRIPS  IN  THE TAHOE  REGION   THERE are many trips in the Tahoe Region which can be made, with greater or lesser ease,       on foot or horseback, in one day, so that one can sleep in his hotel each night.    On the       other hand there are some highly desirable trips that can be taken only by camping-out,       and to these I wish to commend those of my readers of both sexes who are strong enough to       care for such intimate contact with God's great-out-of-doors.   To me one of Life's greatest delights, appealing alike to body, mind and soul, is a       camping-out trip. Breathing day and night the pure air of mountain and forest,          occasionally swept by breezes from desert and ocean,    exercising one's body into vigorous       healthfulness, sweating in the sun with life-giving labor,    even though it be only       tramping or riding up and down trails,    sauntering over meadows, rambling and exploring       untrailed spaces, under giant sky-piercing trees; lying down at night on the restful brown       Mother Earth; sleeping peacefully and dreamlessly through delicious star-and-moon-lit       nights, cooled and refreshed by the night winds, awakening in the morning full of new life       and vigor, to feel the fresh tang of the air and the cool shock of the wash (or even       plunge) in the snow-or-spring-fed stream; companioning with birds and bees, chipmunks and       squirrels, grouse and quail, deer and antelope, trees and plants, shrubs and flowers, lava       and granite, lakes and creeks, rivers and ponds; smelling the sweet fragrance   185   186     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   of the trees, shrubs, plants and vines; bathing in an atmosphere of calm and quiet that       seems almost Divine; covered with a sky as cloudless and pure blue as the dome of heaven       itself, and which, at night, changes into a rich blue-black velvet, studded with silvery       emblazonments, that dance and dazzle in the pellucid air; listening to the varied voices       of Nature, each eager to give tongue to its joy; eating healthful, simple food with       appetite and relish; absorbing the assurance that Nature means good and nothing but good       to man, thus coming nearer to the heart of God; losing the fret and worry of money-getting       and all other of Life's lower ambitions and strivings; feeling the inflow of strength,          physical, mental and spiritual; gaining calmness, serenity, poise and power;     is there       any wonder that a man so blessed should speak and write with radiant and exuberant       enthusiasm of that which has been so lavish to him.    This is what camping-out   (in       part)  means to me.   Hence, when I leave home for a mountain trip I always put into my Indestructo * an extra       blue flannel shirt, riding boots and breeches (or a pair of overalls), a cap, and a bottle       of vaseline. The hunter and fisherman, of course, will bring his especial equipment, as,       also, will the geologist or botanist.   The first essentials of a successful camping-out trip are personal. One must have the       receptive and acceptive spirit. No matter what comes it is for the best; an experience       worth having. Nothing must be complained of. The   grouch   has no place on a       camping-trip, and one who is a  grouch,  a  sissy,  a  faultfinder,  a  worrier,  a   1 Indestructo is the name given to a trunk that has been such a delight to me for its       enduring and useful qualities, that I cannot refrain from   passing it on.  A poor trunk,       to a constant traveler, is a perpetual nuisance and worry. My trunks always gave me       trouble until I got an Indestructo. Since then I have had freedom from all such distress.         It is fully insured for five years.   CAMPING-OUT TRIPS IN TAHOE REGION   187     quitter,  or who cannot or will not enter fully into the spirit of the thing had better       stay at home.   If experiences are met with that are disagreeable, meet them as a man should; a woman       always does,    or always has on trips taken with me. The   self-pitier,  the         self-indulgent,  the   fearful  also had better stay at home.   The next essentials are a good guide     such as is suggested by the Dedication of this book           and good saddle-and-pack-animals, good bedding, good food and the proper season. Then if       the spot you have chosen contains anything worth while, you cannot fail to have an       enjoyable, interesting, educative,  health-giving and  generally profitable time.   In outfitting for such a trip always put into your pocket (and in the pack a reserve       supply) a few Grant's crackers, a handful of Horlick's Malted Milk tablets, and a cake of       Ghirardelli's chocolate. With these you are safe for a whole day or two, or more, if       anything should happen to separate you from your pack animal, or you should desire to ride       on without stopping to prepare a noon, or later, camp meal.   The Tahoe Region offers scores of just such trips, where for one or two months each year       for a dozen years a visitor may camp-out in some new region. For instance, every student       of God's handiwork should go up to Deer Park, camp-out at Five Lakes, and study the       evidences of lava flows at the head of Bear Creek. Go to the Lake of the Woods and spend a       week there, tracing the glacial movements that made Desolation Valley. Take such a trip as       I enjoyed to Hell Hole on the Rubicon, but take more time for it than I could give; cross       the range to the Yosemite, and thus link the two sublimest parts of the Sierras in your       memory; follow the old trails that used to echo to the voices of pioneers from Michigan       Bluff, Last Chance, Hayden Hill, etc.; go out with one of the Forest Rangers and get a       glimpse into his wonderful life of ac-   188     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   tivity, independence and solitude. Thus you will come in contact with larger conceptions,       fuller ideas, deeper sympathies, higher aspirations than is possible where you follow the       ordinary routine of the ordinary, mediocre, self-contented man. Thank God for the spark of       discontent, of ambition, of aspiration, of desire to see beyond, to know more, to climb       higher, to solve the mysteries, to abolish the unknown.   Then, if you dare the perils and joys of winter, get Bob Watson, or some other expert on       snow-shoes to go with you over Tahoe's wild wastes of snow. Emulate Snow-shoe Thompson, a       short sketch of whose life and adventures will be found in my book, Heroes of California,       and henceforth the days and nights of spring, summer, fall and winter will never seem       quite the same to you.   Merely as a sample, the balance of this chapter is devoted to the trip made in the fall of       1913 with Watson from Tahoe Tavern.   TO   HELL   HOLE   AND  THE  RUBICON  RIVER   I certainly think I can conjecture with accuracy the way it received its name. The trails       in and out were first made and used by the wild animals     bear, deer, antelope, mountain       lions, etc., then by the first Americans     the Indians, and at last, by the white man.       Undoubtedly the first whites to come over the trails were miners from the Georgetown and       Placerville districts, lured by the marvelous discoveries of the Comstock lode in Virginia       City. Then in 1862   3 came the Squaw Valley stampede and this  strike  being so much nearer       than the Comstock naturally attracted much attention, especially as the California mines       of the Sierra Nevada were becoming less profitable. One of these old miners, whose       language was more luridly picturesque than refined, on coming into the region or going out       of it,    when he struck the rough, rugged, uncertain,   ANGORA LAKE, NEAR LAKE TAHOE, CALIF.   GLENBROOK ON  THE NEVADA  SIDE OF LAKE TAHOE   THE STEAMER TAHOE, AT THE WHARF, JUST BEFORE STARTING AROUND THE LAKE   CAMPING-OUT TRIPS IN TAHOE REGION   189   rocky, and exceedingly steep grade, must have called it a   hell of a hole   to get into       or out of, and in future references the name stuck until, at last, it was passed down to       future ages on the maps of the U. S. Geological Survey as the true and correct name.   But if the reader thinks the name in the slightest degree characteristic of the place       itself he never made a greater blunder. Instead, it is a paradise of delightful surprises.       A large, fairly level area     hundreds of acres at least     through which runs the clear and       pellucid waters of the Rubicon River on their way to join those of the American, and       dotted all over with giant cedars, pines, firs and live oaks, with tiny secluded meadows,       lush with richest grasses, it is a place to lure the city-dweller for a long and       profitable vacation. Whether he hunts, fishes, botanizes, geologizes or merely loafs and       invites his soul, it is equally fascinating, and he is a wise man who breaks loose from         Society      spelled with either a capital or small letter     the bank, the office, the       counting-house, the store, the warehouse, the mill, or the factory, and, with a genial       companion or two, buries himself away from the outer world in this restful, peaceful, and       God-blessed solitude.   When I first saw it I exclaimed:   Hell Hole? Then give me more of it,  and instead of       hastening on to other places of well-known charm, I insisted upon one day at least of       complete rest to allow its perfection to   seep in   and become a part of my intimate       inner life of remembrance.   It was under Bob Watson's efficient guidance I left Tahoe Tavern, for a five day trip. We       took a pack-horse well laden with grub, utensils for cooking and our sleeping bags. Riding       down the Truckee, up Bear Creek, past Deer Park Springs, I was struck more forcibly than       ever before by the marvelous glacial phenomena in the amphitheater at the head of the       canyon through a portion of which the trail   igo     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   passes, and also with the volcanic masses that rest upon the granite, mainly on the right       hand side of the pass. Its first appearance shows a cap of from two hundred to three       hundred feet in thickness; later on two other patches of it appear, the upper one       presenting the granite and superposed granite on the same level, clearly indicating a       channel of early erosion filled up by the later flow of volcanic matter.   Passing by Five Lakes and down Five Lake Creek to its junction with the canyon down which       we had come from the Little American Valley, we were soon headed down the creek for the       Rubicon. To the right towered Mt. Mildred (8400 feet), on the other side of which is       Shank's Cove. Shank was a sheep-man who for years ran his sheep here during the summer,       taking them down to the Sacramento Valley in winter. After passing several grassy meadows,       cottonwood groves, and alder thickets we reached Bear Pen Creek, a rocky, bone-dry       crossing, nine miles from the divide. To the left, Powder Horn Creek comes in, which heads       on the northwestern slope of the ridge, on which, on the southern side, Barker Creek has       its rise. It received this peculiar name from the fact that General Phipps, from whom       Phipps Peak is named, was once chasing a bear, when suddenly the infuriated animal turned       upon him, made a savage strike at him with his paw and succeeded in knocking the bottom       out of his old-fashioned powder-horn.   Further down we came suddenly upon a hawk who had just captured a grouse, and taken off       his head. As the bird dropped his prey on our approach we took it as a gift of the gods,       and next morning, with two or three quail, it made an excellent breakfast for us.   Nearing the descent into Hell Hole we gained striking glimpses of a great glacially-formed       valley in the mountains on the farther side, while a ridge to our left revealed   CAMPING-OUT TRIPS IN TAHOE REGION   191   a cap of volcanic rock apparently of columnar structure and extending from the eastern end       half way the length of the ridge.   Watson assured me that here he has found herds of sixteen and nineteen deer, on separate       occasions. They seem to follow, in the early spring, the line of the melting snow. At this       time they are tame and fearless, and will stand and look at you with surprise and       impatience. They seldom run away. On one occasion he came upon a doe and two fawns not far       from the brink or ridge of Hell Hole. He was close upon them before he was aware, but       stopped suddenly. The doe saw him, but instead of turning to flee she stood and       impatiently stamped her foot several times. Then as he seemed to pay no attention and to       be harmless, she and her young began to graze again, and shortly disappeared.   Before long we arrived at what may be called the   jumping-off place.  In reality it is a       steep descent into the depths of a wide canyon, but earth has so lodged in the rocky       slopes that they are covered with dense growths of trees and chaparral, so that it is       impossible to see very far ahead. Down, down, down we went, winding and twisting, curving       around and dodging, but getting deeper with every zig-zag until almost as suddenly as we       began the steep descent we found ourselves on a fairly level platform. Hell Hole was       reached.   The day spent here was a delightful one. While Watson fished I wrote, loafed, rambled       about, studied the rock formations, and wished for a week or more instead of a day.   Next morning we struck into the canyon of the Rubicon River, for Soda Spring, half a mile       away, where salt and soda exude in such quantities as to whiten the rocks. Here the deer,       bear, grouse, quail, ground-hogs, and other crea-   192     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   tures come for salt. Indeed, this is a natural   salt lick,  and there are eight or ten       piles of rock, behind which Indian and white hunters used to watch for the coming of the       game they desired to kill. Twenty years ago one could get game here practically every day.       The Washoes used to descend the western slope as far as this; the men for deer, the women       for acorns, though they had to be on the alert as the Sierra Indians resented their       intrusion.   Right and left as we rode on there were great   islands   of granite, fifty to one hundred       feet high, masses that either had been hurled from the heights above in some cataclysm, or       planed to their present shape by long-forgotten glaciers. These granite masses alternate       with flower and shrub-bestrewed meadows that once were glacial lakes. At times we found       ourselves in a dense forest where the trees were ancient monarchs, whose solitudes had       never been disturbed by stroke of ax, or grate of saw. Clumps of dogwood and chaparral of       a dozen kinds confuse the tyro, and he loses all sense of direction. Only the instinct       that makes a real mountain and forest guide could enable one successfully to navigate       these overgrown wilds, for we were now wandering up a region where trails had been       abandoned for years. Here and there, when we came to the rocky slopes   ducks   1 in       confusing variety were found but scarce a sign of a trail, and the   blazes  on the trees       were more confusing than if we had been left to our own devices.   Yellow jackets' nests hung from many branches, and we were now and then pestered by the       flying creatures themselves. Then we had a good laugh. Our pack-horse, Sho-shone, got       between two trees. His head could pass but his pack couldn't, and there he stood       struggling to pull through. He couldn't  do it,  but stupidly he would  not  back up.   1 Ducks are small piles of stone so placed as to denote the course of the trail.   CAMPING-OUT TRIPS IN TAHOE REGION   193   Talk about horse-sense  A burro would have backed up in a minute, but most horses would       struggle in such a place until they died.   Near here there came into sight a granite ridge between the Rubicon and Five Lake Creek.       This grows higher until it becomes quite a mountain, between Five Lake Creek and Barker       Creek. On the right McKinstry Peak (7918 feet) towered up, with its double top, leading       the eye along a ridge of red granite rock to Red Peak.   About three miles up the canyon we found a number of rocky basins in the course of the       Rubicon with water, eight, ten and more feet deep in them, temptingly suggesting a plunge.       I didn't need much tempting, and as quickly as I could disrobe I had plunged in. What a       cold, invigorating shock it was. There's nothing like such a plunge for thoroughly       arousing one and sending the blood quickiy coursing through his veins.   Nearby were great beds of brake-ferns, four and five feet high, groves of immense alders,       sugar pines, some of which were fully eight feet through and the trunks of which were       honeycombed with woodpecker holes. I saw and heard several woodpeckers at work. They had       red top-knots, and the noise they made echoed through the woods more as if a sledge hammer       had struck the tree than the bill of a bird. How they climb up the trunk of the trees,       holding on in a mysterious fashion and moving head up or down, as they desire, with jerky       little pulls, bobbing their heads as if emphasizing some remarks they were making to       themselves.   And what ideal spots for camping-out we passed, shady trees, nearby meadows, to give       abundant feed for the horses, the pure waters of the Rubicon close by, with scenery,       trees, flowers, animals, birds     all the glory of nature     surrounding one with objects of       delight, interest and study.   194     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   One large area was strewn with hundreds of thousands of the big long cones of the sugar       pine. When one wishes to pack and ship home specimens of these and other cones, it is well       to soak them in water. They then close up and carry safely, opening up as before, as they       dry out.   Then we passed some giant   wind falls,  mainly spruces. The roots of these monarchs of       the forest had twined themselves around rocks of every size and shape, some of them       massive bowlders, but when the storm came, the purchase, or leverage of the tall trees was       so great that these heavy rock-masses were pulled out of place and lifted up as the trees       crashed over to their fall.   Now we came to a stretch of perfect virgin forest. No ax, no saw, no log chutes, no       wagons, no dragging of logs, no sign of the hand of man. Nature was the only woodsman,       with her storms and winds, her snows and rains, to soften the soil and uproot her growing       sons and daughters. There was confusion in places, even rude chaos, but in and through and       above it all a cleanness, a sweetness, a purity, a grandeur, harmony, glory, beauty and       majesty     all of which disappear when destroying man comes upon the scene.   About five miles up, we left the Rubicon and struck up toward Barker Creek. Here was       another of the great, tempting granite basins, full of clear cool water. We also passed       patches of belated scarlet larkspur, shooting stars, and glaring golden-rod.   Half a mile up we reached Barker Creek, now a bowlder-strewn arroyo which aroused my       covetousness to high degree. How I would love to build, with my own hands, a cottage,       bungalow or house of some kind with these great bowlders, of varied sizes and colors,       shapes and material.   Just above the junction of Barker Creek and the Rubicon is   Little Hell Hole,  a       camping-place almost as fa-   CAMPING-OUT TRIPS IN TAHOE REGION   195   mous as its larger namesake, and noted for the fact that half a mile away is a small       canyon full of mineral springs     sulphur, iron, soda, magnesia, etc. Naturally it is a         deer-lick,  which makes it a Mecca during the open season to hunters. The springs bubble       up out of the bed of the stream, the water of which is stained with the coloring matter.       When the stream runs low so that one can get to the springs he finds some of them as       pleasant to the taste as those of Rubicon and Glen Alpine.   As we got higher we left the spruces behind, and the junipers, covered with berries, began       to appear. Then we came to open spaces where the wind began to sing in the tops of the       pines.   About a mile up Barker Creek, Watson showed me the course of one of his trails back to the       Tavern. It ascends a formidable ridge and leads quickly to Idlewyld, but we were bound for       Rubicon Springs. The old trail was inaccessible, but Mr. Colwell of the Springs had lately       marked out a new trail, so we took our chances on finding our way somehow. Over windfalls,       up and down and around rocky promontories, we came to West Meadow Creek Wash, its rude       bowlder-strewn course striking directly across our path. Here we struck beds of brakes       nestling in the shade of giant trees. On the left side of the creek where we were, we ran       into dense clumps of wild-cherry which prevented further progress. Scouting found us an       outlet on the other side of Barker Creek. The divide on the left towered up with rugged       majesty, reddish in color, and split into gigantic irregular terraces, the taluses of       which were all crowded with dense chaparral growths.   On this side the slopes were all more open, nothing but rugged  bowlders clinging on  the       bare  surfaces.   How enjoyable was this forcing our way along through      196     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   these solitary wilderness places, so that I was really sorry when we finally dropped over       a forested slope into the Rubicon Springs and McKinney's Road. A mile away we found the       hotel, with Mr. and Mrs. Colwell. The buildings are old but all nature is gloriously grand       and beautiful.   Though cordially invited to stay overnight, we pushed on over the Rubicon River, up the       hill on part of the Georgetown road for a mile and a half,    from which we had a fine view       of Buck Island Lake,    struck the trail for another mile and in the early afternoon made       camp at Rock Bound Lake. Here we rowed and swam, studied the country from the nearby       hills, and then slept the sleep of the healthfully weary under the blue vault of heaven.   Though Rubicon Springs was not far away there was such an air of quietude in this spot       that we felt as if we were in one of Nature's choicest retreats.   Returning to Rubicon we followed the road back to where we had struck it the day before.       The old trail from McKinney's used to come over the divide from the east and strike the       Rubicon near where we then stood, pass by the Springs and then follow the river, but to       avoid the steep grades the road had to be constructed around by Buck Island Lake.   Those who ride into Rubicon Springs from McKinney's, just as they make the last descent,       have a wonderful view of Georgetown Mountain before them. Its sloping side is glacially       planed off at a steep angle, and it reveals the vast extent the great ice field must have       covered in the days of glacial activity. Many bowlders near the Springs are very Btrongly       marked by glacial action.   About a mile from the Springs we came to a tree on which a   cut-off  sign was placed.       When the road was being constructed the builders started a new grade at this point   CAMPING-OUT TRIPS IN TAHOE REGION   197   and after going for a mile or so found it was so steep that it had to be abandoned and a       lesser grade found by going around.   From the summit we could clearly follow the course of the Little Rubicon, and also secured       an excellent view of the sharp point of Rubicon Peak (9193 feet).   A stiff and cool breeze was blowing from the west so we were not sorry to find shelter       from the wind as we entered a wooded park, where the song of the pines cheered us on our       way. Soon we struck the road and followed it until we came to the headwaters of Miller's       Creek on the right. Miller used to run sheep up in the meadows, which afford a smooth       grade for the road for some distance. There are many alders here, which bear mute though       powerful testimony, in the shape of their gnarled and bent over ground-groveling trunks,        of the heavy winters' snows.   These meadows clearly were once glacial lakes, now filled up, and Miller's Creek was the       instrument of their destruction. Crossing the last of the meadows we came to Burton's       Pass, so called from H. D. Burton, another Placerville pioneer who used to cut hay here,       pack it on mules to Mc-Kinney's, and then ship it across to Lakeside, where he sold it for        80 to  100 a ton. We then passed McKinney's old cabin, the place he built and occupied in       1863, before he went to live at the Lake. Only a few fragments now remain, time and storms       having nearly completed the work of destruction.   Nearby was a beautiful lily pond, soon to be a meadow, and just beyond this we stood on       the actual divide between the Great Basin and the Pacific. We were at the head of Phipps       Creek, named on the map General Creek, from General Phipps. At the mouth of the creek this       pioneer located on 160 acres, which, when he died about 1883, was sold to M. H. de Young,       of the San Francisco Chronicle.    After   198     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   holding it for many years he sold it in turn to I. Hellman, the banker, who now uses it as       his summer estate, having built a fine residence upon it.   Near here we lunched at a sheep-herder's camp and heard an interesting story of the       relocation of an old mine that had helped create the Squaw Valley excitement forty years       before. Owing to new and improved methods of extracting the precious metal it is now       deemed that this may soon develop into a paying property.   Returning to the road we passed Jock Ellis's cabin, in a similar state of ruin to that of       McKinney. Ellis Peak (8945 feet) is named after him. He was a Squaw Valley stampeder.       Nearby we saw the largest tamarack I have yet found in the Sierras. It was fully five feet       through and fluted in an interesting and peculiar fashion.   From here we made a mile detour to visit Hank Richards Lake, a beautiful crystal jewel in       an incomparable wooded setting. Then back to Phipps Creek, over a perfect jumble of       granite bowlders and tree-clad slopes until we finally struck the trail and followed it to       the Lake, and thence home to the Tavern.   The reader should observe that in this, as in the chapter on   Trail Trips,  only a sample       is given of a score or more of similar trips. His host at any of the hotels can suggest       others equally interesting.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XVII   HISTORIC  TAHOE  TOWNS   THERE have been only three towns on the immediate  banks of  Lake  Tahoe,  viz.,  Tahoe  City, Glenbrook   and   Incline,   though   Knoxville  was located on the Truckee River only six miles away.   Tahoe City. Tahoe City was founded in 1864 at the collapse of the Squaw Valley mining excitement, the story of which is fully related in another chapter. Practically all its first inhabitants were from the deserted town of Knoxville. They saw that the lumbering industry was active and its permanence fully assured so long as Virginia City, Gold Hill and other Nevada mining-camps remained profitable. The forests around the Lake seemed inexhaustible, and there was no need for them to go back to an uncertainty in the placer mines of El Dorado County, when they were pretty sure to be able to make a good living here. They, also, probably exercised a little imagination and saw the possibilities of Lake Tahoe as a health and pleasure resort. Its great beauty must have impressed them somewhat, and the exploitation of these features may have occurred to them.   Anyhow, in 1864, the Bailey Hotel was erected, and, later, a man named Hill erected the Grand Central. The Squaw Valley excitement had attracted a number from the Nevada camps, and when these men returned they took with them glowing accounts of the beauty of Lake Tahoe, and of the fishing and hunting to be enjoyed there. Thus the Lake received some of its earliest resort patronage.   199   20O     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   During lumbering days it was an active, bustling place, being the nearest town to which the loggers, drivers, tree-fellers, millmen and others could flee for their weekly recreation and periodic carouses. Yet it must not be thought that the town was wholly given over to roughness. Helen Hunt Jackson, a widely traveled and observant woman of finest susceptibilities, says of the Lake Tahoe House, which she visited in stage-coach days, that it was   one of the very best in all California.  It was the stopping-place of the elite who came to see and enjoy Tahoe, and until later and more fashionable hotels were built around the Lake enjoyed great popularity.   As soon as the logging industry declined Tahoe City began to go down, and only the fishing and tourist interests kept it alive.   When the railway was moved over from Glenbrook and the shops and yard of the Transportation Company were established here it regained some of its former activity and life, and is now the chief business center on the Lake. It is the headquarters of the campers who come for pleasure each year, and its store does a very large and thriving business. New cottages are being erected and it is destined ere long to be a stirring pleasure resort town, for, as the delights of Tahoe become more widely known, every available piece of land will increase in value and where there is now one summer home there will be a hundred.   Glenbrook. On the Nevada side of the Lake, Glenbrook used to be one of the most active, busy, bustling towns in the west. It scarcely seems credible to one who visits the quiet, placid resort of to-day that when I first saw it, some thirty years ago, it had three or four large sawmills in constant operation, day and night. It was then regarded, and so designated in the History of Nevada, pub-   HISTORIC TAHOE TOWNS              201   lished in 1881, as   the great lumber manufacturing town of the state.    The town was begun in i860, the land being squatted upon by G. W. Warren, N. E. Murdock, and R. Walton. In 1861 Captain A. W. Pray erected a saw-mill, run by water-power, but as water sometimes failed, when the demand for lumber increased, he changed to steam-power. He also secured a thousand acres, much of it the finest timber land, from the government, using in its purchase Sioux Scrip.   Up to 1862 the only way to travel from California to Carson and Virginia City, south of Lake Tahoe, was by the Placerville road which came by Bijou and Lakeside and then over the Kingsbury Grade, via Friday's Station, afterward called Small's, by which latter name it is still known on the maps of the U. S. Geological Survey. In 1862, however, a new road was projected, branching off to the northwest (the left) from Small's, and following the eastern shore of the Lake, passed Zephyr Cove and Cave Rock to Glenbrook, thence by Spooner's and down King's Canyon to Carson. This was called the Lake Bigler Toll Road (notice the fact that   Tahoe  was then officially designated in Nevada as  Bigler ), and was completed in 1863.   This demanded the opening of a better class of hotel for travelers and others in Glenbrook, and in the same year the road was finished Messrs. Winters and Colbath erected the   Glenbrook Hotel,  which finally came into the hands of Messrs. Yerington and Bliss, who, later, were the builders of the railway, the owners of most of the surrounding timberlands, and who had practical control of the major portion of the lumber interests. But prior to this a lumber-mill was built by J. H. F. Goff and George Morrill   202     THE LAKE OF THE SKY     LAKE TAHOE   in the northern part of the town. This did a good business, for even in those early days common lumber was worth  25.00 per thousand feet, and clear lumber,  45.00. The mill was soon destroyed by fire, but the site was bought by A. H. Davis and Son, who erected a new mill, which they operated for a while and then sold to Wells, Fargo   Co. It was not until 1873 that Yerington   Bliss came to Glen-brook. They revolutionized the lumber industry. While Captain Pray had long used a steam tug to raft logs across Lake Tahoe, the lumber itself was hauled down to Carson and Virginia City. Now, owning large areas of timber-land, operating two and then three saw-mills in Glenbrook, and several others in the nearby mountains, Messrs. Yerington   Bliss sought easier means of transportation for their merchandisable product. They constructed dams and reservoirs, with V flumes in a number of places, making them converge as near as possible at the Summit, some six miles from Glenbrook. To this point they built a narrow gauge railway for the purpose of transporting the millions of feet of lumber sawn at their mills.   From Summit a large V flume was constructed down Clear Creek Canyon into Carson City, and into this flume a constant stream of water was poured from the reservoirs which carried upon its bosom another stream of boards, timber, studding, joists and sheathing, the two streams emptying simultaneously just outside of Carson City at a point on the Virginia   Truckee railway, where the lumber was loaded and thence shipped to its place of consumption.   That tremendous amounts of lumber were being manufactured is shown by the fact that the official records of Douglas County, Nevada, for 1875, give 21,700,000 feet as the product for that year.   One  department  of the  lumber business should  not  be   HISTORIC TAHOE TOWNS            203   overlooked in this connection. As the timber disappeared from the mountain slopes nearest Glenbrook, the operators were compelled to go further afield for their logs. These were cut on the mountain slopes north, south, east and west, and sent down the   chutes   into the Lake. Where the ground was level great wagons, drawn by ten, sixteen, twenty oxen, hauled the logs to the shore, where they were dumped into the water. Here they were confined in   booms,  consisting of a number of long, thin poles fastened together at the ends with chains, which completely encircled a   raft   of logs arranged in the form of a V. The raft was then attached, by strong cables, to a steamer and towed to Glenbrook, where the mills were so located that the logs were drawn up from the Lake directly upon the saw-carriages. The size of some of the rafts may be imagined when it is known that they yielded from 250,000 to 300,000 feet of lumber.   The principal vessel for this purpose at the time I first visited Lake Tahoe in 1881 was an iron tug, called the Meteor. It was built in 1876 at Wilmington, Delaware, by Harlan, Hollingsworth   Co., then taken apart, shipped by rail to Carson City and hauled by teams to Lake Tahoe. It was a propeller, eighty feet long and ten feet beam, and cost  18,000.   The first store erected in Glenbrook was placed on piles over the water. This was built in 1874, by J. A. Rigby and A. Childers. One morning the latter partner disappeared, and it was surmised that he had fallen into the water and was drowned. New partners were taken into the firm, but in January, 1877, tne store was burned, and it was not re-erected on its original site.   When the lumber interests and the railway were removed Glenbrook declined, until it was the most deserted looking place possible.    Then the sons of Mr. Bliss, one of whom   204     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   was born there, cleared away all the evidences of its former lumbering activities, built a handsome and commodious modern hotel on the most scenic point, and re-established the place as a choice resort on the Nevada shore, as described elsewhere.   Incline. It will be a source of interest, even to many who know Lake Tahoe well, that there used to be a town named Incline on its shores. In the curve of Crystal Bay, a few miles from where the scars show where the water escaped from. Marlette Lake flume, this town was located in 1882. It was the source of supplies for the lumbering interests of the Sierra Nevada Wood and Lumber Company, and received its name from a sixteen-hundred feet incline up which lumber was hauled. The incline was operated by an endless cable, somewhat after the style of Mount Lowe, in Southern California, the car on one side going up, and on the other coming down one trip, and vice versa the next. The lumber thus raised was thrown into the flume, carried therein around to Lake View, on the line of the Virginia and Truckee railway, there loaded on cars and shipped to Carson and Virginia, largely for use in the mines.   When the logging interests were active the place had quite a population, had its own post-office and was an election precinct. When the logging interests waned the town declined, and in 1898 the post office was discontinued. Now nothing remains but the old incline, grown up with weeds and chaparral. New towns are springing up at Al Tahoe, Lakeside and Carnelian Bay which will soon demand a revision of this chapter.

        <pagetext>LAKE TAHOE FROM TAHOE TAVERN   STEAMER TAHOE ROUNDING RUBICON POINT, LAKE TAHOE   McKINNEY'S AND MOANA  VILLA, WITH RUBICON PEAKS IN   THE DISTANCE, LAKE TAHOE   STEAMER LANDING, McKINNEY'S, LAKE TAHOE   CHAPTER XVIII   BY STEAMER  AROUND   LAKE  TAHOE   THE ride around Lake Tahoe is one of varied delights, as the visitor sees not only the       Lake itself from every possible angle, but gains an ever shifting panorama of country,       and, more remarkable than all, he rides directly over that wonderful kaleidoscope of       changing color that is a never-ceasing surprise and enchantment.   Tahoe Tavern is the starting point of the ride, the train conveying the passenger directly       to the wharf from which he takes the steamer.    Capt. Pomin is in control.   Not far from where this, the most beautiful and charm-nig hotel of the Lake is erected,       there used to be a logging camp, noted as the place from which the first ties were cut for       that portion of the Central Pacific Railroad lying east of the summit of the Sierras. A       number of beautiful private residences line the Lake for some distance, the area having       been portioned out in acre and half-acre lots. Chief of these are the summer home of       Professor W. T. Reid, for a time President of the State University of California, and       Idlewyld, the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Kohl, of San Francisco.   One of the oldest villas of this portion of the Lake used to be owned by Thomas McConnell,       of Gait, and it was his daughter, Mary, who first made the ascent of one of the peaks now       known as Maggie's Peaks, as a marble tablet placed there testifies.   In the mountains beyond are Ward's Peak (8665 feet) to the right, and Twin Peak (8924) to       the left, from the first   205   206     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   of which heads Ward's Creek, and the second Blackwood Creek, both entering the Lake two       miles or so apart. Just beyond Twin Peak are Barker's Peak (8000 feet), and nearer to the       Lake, Ellis Peak (8745 feet), the waters from the former making the South Fork of       Blackwood Creek. Ellis Peak, being easily reached by a good trail, is the common point of       ascent from Homewood, McKinney's, Tahoe Tavern and other resorts.   Six miles out from the Tavern, the first stop is made at Homewood, one of the newer       resorts.   Three and one-half to four miles further along is McKinney's, one of the oldest, best       known and well established resorts on Lake Tahoe. It was founded by J. W. Mc-Kinney, who       was first attracted to this region by the Squaw Valley excitement. (See special chapter.)       For a time in 1862-3 he sold lots on the townsite of Knoxville, then when the bottom       dropped out of the   boom  he returned to Georgetown, engaged in mining, but returned to       Tahoe in or about 1867, located on 160 acres on the present site and in 1891-2, after       having erected two or three cottages, embarked fairly and fully in the resort business.       For several years his chief patronage came from the mining-camps, etc., of Nevada, Gold       Hill, Virginia City, Dayton, Carson City, Genoa, etc. They came by stage to Glenbrook and       thence across the Lake, on the small steamer that already was doing tourist business in       summer and hauling logs to the lumber mills in winter and spring. Thus this resort gained       its early renown.   The bottom of the Lake may be seen at a considerable depth near McKinney's, and looks like       a piece of mosaic work. The low conical peak, back of McKinney's is about 1400 feet above       the Lake and used to be called by Mc-Kinney, Napoleon's Hat.   The next stop of the steamer is quite close to McKinney's,   BY STEAMER AROUND LAKE TAHOE     207   viz., Moana Villa, and a mile or so further on at Pomin's, the former an old established       resort, and the latter an entirely new one. After passing Sugar Pine Point, Meek's Bay and       Grecian Bay are entered. These two shallow indentations along the shore line are places       where the color effects are more beautiful than anywhere else in the Lake, and vie with       the attractions of the shore in arresting the keen attention of the traveler. Meek's Bay       is three miles long, and, immediately ahead, tower the five peaks of the Rubicon Range,       some 3000 feet above the Lake. Beyond, a thousand feet higher, is snow-crowned Tallac,          the mountain     as the Washoe Indians called it, the dominating peak of the southwest end       of the Lake.   Rubicon Point is the extension of the Rubicon Range and it falls off abruptly into the       deepest portion of the Lake. The result is a marvelous shading off of the water from a       rich sapphire to a deep purple, while the shore on either side varies from a bright       sparkling blue to a blue so deep and rich as almost to be sombre. Well, indeed, might Lake       Tahoe be named   the Lake of ineffable blue.  Here are shades and gradations that to       reproduce in textile fabrics would have pricked a king's ambition, and made the dyers of       the Tyrian purple of old turn green with envy. Solomon in his wonderful temple never saw       such blue as God here has spread out as His free gift to all the eyes, past, present and       to come, and he who has not yet seen Tahoe has yet much to learn of color glories,       mysteries, melodies, symphonies and harmonies.   Soon, Emerald Bay is entered. This is regarded by many as the rich jewel of Lake Tahoe.       The main body of the Bay is of the deep blue our eyes have already become accustomed to,       but the shore-line is a wonderful combination of jade and emerald, that dances and       scintillates as the breeze plays with the surface of the waters.   208     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   A landing is made at Emerald Bay Camp, one of the most popular resorts of the Lake, and       while at the landing the curious traveler should take a good look at the steep bank of the       opposite shore. This is a lateral moraine of two glaciers, one of which formed Emerald       Bay, as is explained in Chapter VIII, and the other formed Cascade Lake, which nestles on       the other side of the ridge.   At the head of Emerald Bay, also, is Eagle Falls, caused by the outflow of water from       Eagle Lake, which is snugly ensconced at the base of the rugged granite cliffs some three       miles inland.   Four miles beyond Emerald Bay is Tallac, one of the historic resorts on the Lake.   Tallac was originally Yanks. Yank was really Ephraim Clement, originally a Yankee from       Maine, a stout, hearty, bluff man, who homesteaded his land, added to it until he owned       about a thousand acres, and finally sold out to E. J. (Lucky) Baldwin. Baldwin had come       over from Virginia City and seeing the great havoc made in the fine timber, of which he       was very fond, exclaimed with an oath:   Someone will be cutting this (the timber of       Yanks) next,  and then and there he began to bargain for the place. In 1878 he bought,       changed the name, and thenceforward Tallac became known. Little by little, as Yank had       done, so Baldwin bought from sheep-men, squatters, and others until he had quite a       holding.   The hotel was built and in 1879 Sharp Brothers ran it. In 1880 Capt. Gordon was manager       for a year, and in 1881 Baldwin gave a lease to Messrs. Lawrence   Corn-stock who held it       until 1914.   Baldwin was a great lover of trees, and when the present hotel and cottages were built,       not a single tree was cut without his express permission. Yet he had no foolish sentiment       about the matter as is proven by the fact that all the buildings   BY STEAMER AROUND LAKE TAHOE     209   were constructed from local lumber produced in his own sawmill, except the redwood used       for finishing. The hotel as it now stands was completed in 1900.   Gulls, pelicans and mud-hens can generally be seen in large numbers around the piers at       Tallac, and the fleet of fishing boats, each with its one or more eager anglers, is one of       the sights.   The steamer stops here long enough to allow a few minutes ashore, and the visitors ramble       over to the hotel, chat or chaffer with the Washoe Indian squaws who have their baskets       for sale, or enjoy the grassy and shaded grounds.   From the wharf at Tallac visitors for Glen Alpine, Fallen Leaf Lodge, and Cathedral Park       take their respective stages. These three resorts are within a few miles and afford       additional opportunities for lovers of the region to add to their knowledge of its scenic,       botanic, arboreal and geologic features. Indeed such glacial experts as Joseph LeConte,       John Muir, and David Starr Jordan have united in declaring that the region around Glen       Alpine gives a better opportunity for the study of comparatively recent glacial phenomena       than any other known area.   Adjoining Tallac on the east is the private residence of W. S. Tevis, of San Francisco.       His beautiful yacht, the Consuelo, may generally be seen anchored here, when not in actual       service.   Half a mile from Tallac is The Grove, close to the Upper Truckee River, the main feeder of       Lake Tahoe, and four miles further is Al-Tahoe, a new and well-equipped hotel, standing on       a bluff commanding an expansive view of the Lake. It practically occupies the site of an       old resort well-known as   Rowland's.  It is near to Freel's Peak (10,900 feet), which in       olden days was known as Sand Mountain, on account of its summit being composed of sand.   A mile and a half further along is Bijou, a pleasant and   210     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   comfortable stopping place, while three miles further a picturesque rustic pavilion on the       end of the pier denotes Lakeside Park, a well-known and long-famous resort. Forty-five       years ago, or more, Capt. W. W. Latham built the famous State Line House at this point,       and twenty years ago it came into the hands of its present owners.   This is the most easterly of all the resorts and settlements at the south end of Lake       Tahoe. It is in California, in El Dorado County, though its post-office is Stateline, the       dividing line between California and Nevada. The Park is over 2000 acres in extent and has       already became the nucleus for a choice summer residence section.   Leaving Lakeside Park the steamer now turns northward and follows the eastern or Nevada       shore, until Cave Rock is passed and Glenbrook is reached. This is the only resort on that       side of Lake Tahoe. Once the scene of an active, busy, lumber town, where great mills       daily turned out hundreds of thousands of feet of timber for the mines of Virginia City       and the building up of the great historic mining-camps of Nevada, the magic of change and       of modern improvements has swept away every sign of these earlier activities and left       Glenbrook a quiet, delightful, restful resort, nestling in its own wide and expansive       meadows at the foot of towering mountains that give a rich and contrasting background for       the perennial beauty of the Lake. Practically all that remains to remind one of the old       days are the remnants of the logging piers and cribs, the school-house, the quiet   City       of Those who are Gone,  and further up the hills, the old railroad grade on which the logs       were carried to the mill and the lumber taken through the tunnel, which still remains, to       the flume by which it was further conveyed to the railroad at Carson City.   Immediately to the right of Glenbrook, ias the steamer   BY STEAMER AROUND LAKE TAHOE     211   heads for the wharf, can be seen the celebrated Shakspere Rock.    John Vance Cheney, the       poet, thus describes it:   No sooner had the steamer been made fast than a ledge of rocks was pointed out to us,       rising precipitously some distance from the pier.   Can't you see it?  again and again       asked our guide, renewing his endeavor to dispel our distressing stupidity. At length         it  appeared to us, and we stood mute with astonishment. There, on the front of a bold       cliff, graven with all the care of the best copies with which we are familiar, looked down       upon us the face of Shakspere  As if in remembrance of her favorite son, here in this far       wild region, nature had caused his features, cut in everlasting rock, to be hung on high,       a fitting symbol of his intellectual sovereignty over the world. The likeness needs no aid       from the imagination: it is life-like, recognized instantly by the most careless observer,       and, let it be added, never forgotten. The beard is a trifle longer than we are accustomed       to see it, but this deviation does not detract from the majesty of expression becoming the       illustrious original. The spacious forehead, the nose, even the eyes, all are admirably       represented. A more astounding surprise it has not been the writer's fortune to       experience. The portrait looks as if it were made by moss growing upon the smooth flat       surface of a huge rock; but we were informed that the face is all of stone, and has       undergone no perceptible change since its discovery about five years since.  This was       written in 1882.  A lady tourist from Massachusetts has, it is believed, the honor of       first pointing it out. Nature cannot forget her Shakspere. So we all mused, and, musing,       would have forgotten our dinners, had we not been summoned inside the hotel. The repast       was not peculiarly relishable; consequently, we had all the more opportunity to feed       spiritually upon the masterpiece on the cliff,    the rock-portrait of Avon's, of England's,       of the World's immortal bard.   As the steamer leaves Glenbrook one may gain clear and distinct views of the four       prominent peaks of the Nevada side. Above Lakeside, at the southeast end, is Monument       Peak,   212     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   then, about midway between Lakeside and Glenbrook is a sharp-pointed bare mass of rock       known as Genoa Peak. Immediately behind Glenbrook is Dubliss Mountain (8729 feet), so       named after Duane Bliss, father and son, both of whom have done so much to make Tahoe       known to the world. Marlette Peak is to the northeast, 8864 feet, with Snow Valley Peak,       9214 feet, a little to the South. These both overshadow Marlette Lake, a full description       of which is given elsewhere. All these peaks afford excellent views of Lake Tahoe on the       one side and of the valleys and mountains of western Nevada on the other.   The steamer now continues along the Nevada shore, past the scars caused by the breaking of       the Marlette Lake flume, by Crystal Bay and the site of the old town of Incline, around       State Line Point to Brockway.   This resort has been long and favorably known for its famous hot mineral springs. The hot       water is piped to all rooms and private baths of the hotels and cottages, and is a great       source of pleasure as well as health-giving comfort to the guests.   We are now on the home-stretch, and soon after leaving Brockway (1  miles away) and       forty-five minutes (eight miles) from Tahoe Tavern, we reach Tahoe Vista. Here one is       afforded a perfect view of the Lake and its snowcapped ranges east and south.   Crossing Agate and Carnelian Bays the steamer's last stop is at Carnelian Bay. Here there       is great building activity going on and many neat and commodious cottages and bungalows       are being erected.   Observatory Point is the last object passed before the Tavern is again reached. This name       was given because of the fact that it was once the chosen site, by James Lick, for the       observatory he contemplated building. This plan, however, was never carried out, as it was       shown to the philan-   RUBICON POINT, LAKE TAHOE   BROCKWAY'S HOT SPRINGS HOTEL, LAKE TAHOE   SNOWBALLING IN JUNE, JULY AND AUGUST, NEAR THE   SUMMIT OF  THE CRAGS,  DEER PARK SPRINGS,   LAKE TAHOE   FISHING IN GRASS LAKE, NEAR GLEN ALPINE SPRINGS   BY STEAMER AROUND LAKE TAHOE     213   thropist that the cold weather of winter would work exceeding hardship upon the       astronomers without any compensating advantages. The result was the Observatory was       finally established on Mt. Hamilton, and it is now a part of the great California       University system.   Thus the complete circuit of Lake Tahoe is made daily in summer by the steamer, and no       matter how often the trip is taken it never palls upon the intelligent and careful       observer. New glories and wonders are constantly springing forth as pleasant surprises and       one soon learns to realize that here Nature indeed has been most prodigal in her scenic       gifts to mankind.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XIX   DEER  PARK  SPRINGS   WHILE in one sense all the resorts of the Tahoe region are mountain resorts, a difference       should be noted between those that are located directly on the shores of Lake Tahoe, or       some lesser lake, and those that are away from immediate proximity to a lake. The latter       type is more correctly designated mountain resorts, and of these are three in the Tahoe       region, viz., Deer Park Springs, Rubicon Springs and Glen Alpine. All these resorts were       discovered by following the trails of animals which were visiting them for   salt licks         that existed in connection with their mineral waters as related in the chapter on Glen       Alpine. Deer Park is a private estate of approximately 469 acres, in two sections, one the       Mineral Springs Section, consisting of nearly 309 acres, and on which the celebrated       springs     two of soda, one of sulphur, and one of iron     are located, and the other, the       Five Lakes Section, of 160 acres. The former begins a mile from the Truckee River, up Bear       Creek Canyon. This was originally taken up from the Government as timber claims, but the       timber has never been cut, and the great pines, firs and junipers remain as the original       settlers found them. The Five Lakes section is a fascinating and attractive location two       miles away, over the first divide of the mountains, and therefore 1000 feet higher than       the Inn, where five glacial lakes nestle in their granite basin. Four of these, and a       large part of the fifth, are included in the estate, while all surrounding is government       land of the   214   DEER PARK SPRINGS                    215   Tahoe National Forest. If a dam were built to restrain the flow of water into Five Lake       Creek, it would need only to be ten feet high to convert the five lakes into one, so near       are they to the same level.   As it is the flow from these lakes forms Five Lakes Creek, which empties into the Rubicon       and thence into the South Fork of the American.   Five Lakes afford excellent fishing and a log-cabin, three boats and fishing tackle are       kept here throughout the season for the pleasure of guests. Those who disdain the ordinary       accommodations of a hotel can here camp out, rough it, and make it their headquarters       while climbing the adjoining peaks or exploring the ravines and canyons at the head of the       American River.   In 1914 a student from Stanford University was host at the Five Lakes log-cabin. He cooked       for those who desired it, helped gather fir boughs for camp beds, prepared fishing-tackle       for women anglers, rowed them to and fro over the lakes, and accompanied parties to the       nearby summits. There are full accommodations at the cabin for seven persons, and the rule       of the camp is that guests stay only one night, moving on to make room for the next comer,       unless arrangements for a longer stay are made beforehand. Thus all the guests at Deer       Park Inn may enjoy this novel experience if they so desire.   In the region of Five Lakes, Basque and other foreign shepherds may be found tending their       flocks, and prospectors, with queer little pack-burros, who climb the mountains seeking       the elusive gold, as they did in the days of '49.   It was from Deer Park that the trail into the famous Hell Hole was recut by Miss Katherine       Chandler, owner of the Inn and estate, in 1908, after having been lost for many years.       Arrangements for this trip, and other famous hunting and fishing trips may be made at the       Inn and many   216     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   people who have gone over the mountains to the Yosemite have outfitted and secured their       guide here.   One of the finest trail trips of the Tahoe region is that afforded over the trail, back of       Deer Park Inn, to the rugged pile known as The Crags, over Inspirational Ridge to Ward's       Peak. In the early part of the season great snow banks are encountered, and when the       flowers begin to bloom there are great fields covered with Sierran primroses, with many       patches of white heather and beautiful cyclamens. This is but one of many fine trail trips       that may be made.   Deer Park Inn is one of the oldest and best established resorts of the Tahoe region. The       house that I occupied on my short visit was a solid log cabin, full of romantic interest,       for it was quaint, old-fashioned and appropriate to the surroundings. The key-note of the       place is comfort. Under its present management a large number of wild New England flowers       have been planted to add their beauty to that of the native California flower, and each       year, about the third week in July, the guests wander over the sun-kissed slopes, climb       the snowy heights and ramble through the shady woods gathering Sierran flowers of every       hue, form and variety for an annual flower show. This is one of the distinctive features       of the life at Deer Park Inn.   It is an interesting fact here to notice that, when Miss Parsons, chief author of Flowers       of California, was preparing that volume, she found such a wealth of mountain flora in the       Deer Park region that she spent about as many weeks as she had planned for days. Other       botanists have found it equally productive.   To those who come early in the season toboganning and snow shoeing are not unusual       experiences. The shady sides of the mountains offer these winter sports as late as June       and early July, and many Californians who have never enjoyed   DEER PARK SPRINGS                    217   the frolic of snow-balling come here to gain their first experience in this common eastern       enjoyment.   Elsewhere I have referred to the many evidences of glacial action found about a mile above       Deer Park Inn. Still further up the canyon, on the trail going to Five Lakes, are       interesting deposits of volcanic rock     andeside     so that these two geological phenomena       may be studied close at hand.   Having its own rich meadows on Bear Creek, the Deer Park Spring tables are always supplied       with good milk and cream from its own dairies, while fresh fruit and vegetables are       supplied daily. Fish and game in season are frequent, and the table being under the direct       and personal supervision of the management has gained an enviable reputation.   Living water flows in marvelous abundance through Deer Park all throughout the year.       Springs and melting snow send four different streams, tributary to Bear Creek, coursing       across the property. The domestic water supply of the Inn is gained from springs on the       mountain side, 800 feet above the Inn, and it is piped all over the place and to every       cottage.   There has been some talk, recently, of converting Deer Park into a private park. There is       no better location for such a purpose in the whole Tahoe region. Situated as it is in the       heart of a canyon it is readily isolated and thus kept entirely secluded and free from       intrusion. While such a procedure would be a great advantage to any individual or club who       might purchase the estate, it would be a decided loss to the general public who for so       many years have enjoyed the charms and delights of this earliest of Sierran mountain       resorts.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XX   RUBICON   SPRINGS   ONE of the oldest and most famous resorts of the High Sierras is Rubicon Springs. It is       nine miles from Lake Tahoe, at McKinney's, over a mountain road built many years ago,       engineered so as to afford marvel-ously entrancing glimpses of the Lake and of the       mountain scenery on either hand. Here are primeval forest, flower-strewn meadows of       emerald, crystal streams and placid-faced glacial lakes in which snow-clad mountain       summits are mirrored in quiet glory. The Rubicon River is one of the feeders of the       American River, and the springs are located not far from its head waters.   The Rubicon Springs were originally discovered and located upon by the Hunsaker brothers,       two genuine explorers and adventurers whose names deserve to be preserved in connection       with the Tahoe region. They were originally from the Hoosier state, coming to California       in 1849, across the plains, by Fort Hall, the sink of the Humboldt, Ragtown, and by Carson       Canyon to old Hangtown (now Placerville). They mined for several years. Then came the       Comstock excitement. They joined the exodus of miners for the Nevada mountains and were       among the earliest to help to construct the Georgetown trail. Thus it was they discovered       Rubicon. In 1869 they located upon 160 acres, built a log-house and established a stopping       station which they called Hunsaker Springs. In the winter they rested or returned to       Georgetown, making occasional trapping trips, hunting   218   RUBICON SPRINGS                    219   bear and deer, and the meat of which they sold. In those days deer used to winter in large       numbers almost as far down as Georgetown (some fifteen miles or so), so that hunting them       for market was a profitable undertaking in the hands of experts.   They and John McKinney, the founder of McKinney's, were great friends, having worked       together in the Georgetown mines. They soon made their places famous. Their mining friends       came over from Virginia City, Gold Hill, Carson, etc., by way of Glenbrook, where they       were ferried across Lake Tahoe by the old side-wheel steamer, Governor Stanford, to       McKinney's. Then by pack trail over to Hun-sakers.   For many years they used to cut a great deal of hay from the nearby meadows. A natural       timothy grows, sometimes fully four feet high. A year's yield would often total fully       thirty tons, for which the highest price was paid at the mines.   There was another spring, beside Hunsakers', about a mile higher up, owned by a friend of       the Hunsakers, named Potter. In time he sold this spring to a Mrs. Clark, who finally sold       it back to him, when it was bought by Mr. R. Colwell, of Moana Villa. When the Hunsakers       grew too old to run their place they sold it to a man named Abbott, who, in due time       wished to sell out. But, in the meantime the railroad had surveyed their land, granted by       Congress, and found that the springs and part of the hotel building were on their land, so       that while Abbott sold all his holdings to Mr. Colwell, he could not sell the main objects       of the purchaser's desire. An amicable arrangement, however, was made between all the       parties at interest.   Mr. Colwell is now the owner of all the property.   For countless centuries the Indians of both west and east of Tahoe were used to congregate       in the Rubicon country. They came to drink the medicinal waters, fish, catch deer   220     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   and game birds, and also gather acorns and pine nuts. How well I remember my own visit to       the Springs in the fall of 1913. Watson and I had had three delightful days on the trail       and in Hell Hale, and had come, without a trail, from Little Hell Hole up to Rubicon. The       quaking aspens were dropping their leaves, the tang of coming winter was in the air,       mornings and evenings, yet the middle of the day was so warm that we drank deeply of the       waters of the naturally carbonated springs. No, this statement is scarcely one of fact. It       was warm, but had it been cold, we, or, at least, I should have drank heartily of the       waters because I liked them. They are really delicious, and thousands have testified to       their healthfulness.   We saw the station of the water company, where a man remains through the year to register       the river's flow and the snowfall. Then we passed a large lily lake to the left,    a once       bold glacial lake now rapidly nearing the filled-up stage ere it becomes a mountain meadow           and were fairly on the Georgetown grade, the sixty mile road that reaches from       McKinney's to Georgetown. It is a stern road, that would make the   rocky road to Dublin         look like a   flowery bed of ease,  though we followed it only a mile and a half to leave       it for the steep trail that reaches Rock Bound Lake. This is one of the larger of the       small glacial lakes of the Tahoe Region, and is near enough to Rubicon Springs to be       reached easily on foot.   From a knoll close by one gains an excellent panorama of Dick's, Jack's and Ralston's       Peaks. Tallac and Pyramid are not in sight. The fishing here is excellent, the water deep       and cold and the lake large enough to give one all the exercise he needs in rowing.   On the summit of the Georgetown road one looks down upon the nearby placid bosom of Buck       Island Lake. It received this name from Hunsaker,    The lake is very irregu-   ANGORA LAKES, FALLEN LEAF LAKE AND LAKE TAHOE   WHITE CLOUD FALLS, CASCADE LAKE   UPPER EAGLE FALLS,  EMERALD BAY, LAKE TAHOE   RUBICON SPRINGS   221   lar in shape, about a third of a mile long, and a quarter of a mile wide in its widest       part. Near one end is a small island. Hunsaker found the deer swam over to this island to       rest and sleep during the heat of the day, hence the name.   The Little Rubicon river flows into Buck Island Lake and out again, and about two miles       below Rubicon Springs the Georgetown road crosses the river at the foot of the lake.   With these two lakes, and others not far away, fine hunting and fishing, with several       mountains nearby for climbing, the hotsprings, a fine table and good horses to ride it can       well be understood that Rubicon Springs makes a delightful summer stopping-place. One       great advantage that it possesses, under its present proprietorship is that guests may       alternate between Moana Villa and the Springs and thus spend part of their time on the       Lake and the other part in the heart of the mountains. The Colwells are hearty and       homelike hosts, and are devoted to giving their many guests the greatest possible       enjoyment, pleasure and health that a summer's vacation can contain.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXI   EMERALD  BAY  AND  CAMP   SITUATED near the southwest corner of Lake Tahoe is Emerald Bay, by many thousands       regarded as the choicest portion of Lake Tahoe. Surrounded by so many wonderful scenes, as       one is at Tahoe, it is difficult to decide which possesses surpassing power, but few there       are who see Emerald Bay without at once succumbing to its allurement. Its geological       history has already been given in Chapter VIII, in which it is clearly shown by Dr. Joseph       Le Conte that it was once a glacial lake, and that the entrance to the main lake used to       be the terminal moraine that separated the two bodies of water. As a natural consequence,       therefore, visitors may expect to find evidences of glacial action on every hand. They are       not disappointed. The walls of the Bay, on both north and south, are composed of glacial       detritus, that of the south being a pure moraine, separating the once glacial lake of       Emerald Bay from Cascade Lake.   Emerald Bay is about three miles in length, with a southwesterly trend, and half a mile       wide. The entrance is perhaps a quarter of a mile wide and is formed by a triangular spit       of sand, on which grows a Ions pine, on the one side, and a green chaparral-clad slope,       known as Eagle Point, on the other. The Bay opens and widens a little immediately the       entrance is joined. The mountains at the head of the Bay form a majestic background. To       the southwest (the left) is Mount Tallac, with a rugged, jagged and irregular ridge       leading to the west, disappearing behind two   222   EMERALD BAY AND CAMP              223   tree-clad sister peaks, which dominate the southern side of the Bay's head. These are       known as Maggie's Peaks (8540 and 8725 feet respectively, that to the south being1 the       higher), though originally their name, like that of so many rounded, shapely, twin peaks       in the western world gained by the white man from the Indian, signified* the       well-developed breasts of the healthy and vigorous maiden. Emerging from behind these the       further ridge again appears with a nearer and smoother ridge, leading up to a broken and       jagged crest that pierces the sky in rugged outline. A deep gorge is clearly suggested in       front of this ridge, in which Eagle Lake nestles, and the granite mass which forms the       eastern wall of this gorge towers up, apparently higher than the nearer of Maggie's peaks,       and is known as Phipps' Peak (9000 feet). This is followed by still another peak, nearer       and equally as high, leading the eye further to the north, where its pine-clad ridge       merges into more ridges striking northward.   Between Maggie's and Phipps' Peaks the rocky masses are broken down into irregular, half       rolling, half rugged foothills, where pines, firs, tamaracks and cedars send their pointed       spires upwards from varying levels. In the morning hours, or in the afternoon up to       sunset, when the shadows reveal the differing layers, rows, and levels of the trees, they       stand out with remarkable distinctness, each tree possessing its own perfectly discernible       individuality, yet each contributing to the richness of the clothing of the mountainside,       as a whole.   Down across the lower portion of Maggie's Peaks, 100 to 200 feet above the level of the       Bay, the new automobile road has ruled its sloping line down to the cut, where a sturdy       rustic bridge takes it over the stream which conveys the surplus waters from Eagle Lake to       the Bay. On the other side it is lost in the rolling foothills and the tree-lined lower   224     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   slopes of Cathedral Peak from whence it winds and hugs the Lake shore, over Rubicon Point       to Tahoe Tavern.   But Emerald Bay has other romantic attractions besides its scenery. In the early 'sixties       Ben Holladay, one of the founders of the great Overland Stage system that reached from the       Pacific Coast to the Missouri River, built a pretentious house at the head of the Bay.       Naturally it was occupied by the family only part of the time, and in 1879, a tramp,       finding it unoccupied, took up his lodgings therein, and, as a mark of his royal       departure, the structure burned down the next morning. The site was then bought by the       well-known capitalist, Lux, of the great cattle firm of Miller   Lux, and is now owned by       Mrs. Armstrong.   As the steamer slowly and easily glides down the Bay, it circles around a rocky islet, on       which a number of trees find shelter. This island was inhabited at one time by an       eccentric Englishman, known as Captain Dick, who, after having completed a cottage to live       in, carried out the serious idea of erecting a morgue, or a mausoleum, as a means of final       earthly deposit upon dissolution. This queer-looking dog-house might have become a       sarcophagus had it not been for one thing, viz., Captain Dick, one dark and stormy night,       having visited one of the neighboring resorts where he had pressed his cordial       intemperately, determined to return to his solitary home. In vain the danger was urged       upon him. With characteristic obstinacy, enforced by the false courage and destruction of       his ordinarily keen perception by the damnable liquor that had   stolen away his brains,        he refused to listen, pushed his sail-boat from the wharf and was never seen again. His       overturned boat was afterwards found, blown ashore.            THE MARBLE TABLET ON ONE OF MAGGIE'S PEAKS, BEARING   THE INSCRIPTION:  FLEETWOOD PEAK, ASCENDED   BY MISS  MARY McCONNELL, SEPT.  12,  1869.    THE  ISLAND IN   EMERALD  MAY,  LAKE TAHOE       WHISPERING PINES,  AL TAHOE, ON LAKE TAHOE   E. S.  BROWN COTTAGE, AL TAHOE, ON   LAKE TAHOE   EMERALD BAY AND CAMP   225   EMERALD   BAY  CAMP   Emerald Bay is made accessible to regular summer guests by Emerald Bay Camp, one of the       choice and highly commendable resorts of the Tahoe region. The Camp is located snugly       among the pines of the north side of the Bay, and consists of the usual hotel, with nearby       cottages and tents.   Less than five minutes' walk connects it with the picturesque Automobile Boulevard, and in       due time there is little doubt but that automobiles will be able to descend to the Camp,       and their owners enjoy its hospitality.   Its location suggests many advantages for the angler, the famous Indian fishing grounds       being located at the mouth of the bay. Cascade, Eagle, and the unfished Velma Lakes are       easily accessible to trampers, the outlets from these furnishing sporty brook trout       fishing. These streams and lakes are all stocked with Eastern brook, Loch Levin and       cutthroat. The protected waters of the bay make boating safe and bathing a comfortable       delight.   But not all the beauty of nature and the advantages, of excellent location can make a       popular camp. There is much in the individuality of those who own or   run   it. Emerald       Bay Camp is owned by Mr. Nelson L. Salter, for many years so favorably known in the       Yosemite Valley, and his manager is Miss Frances A. Hickey, whose experienced management       at Camp Lost Arrow, of the Yosemite, endeared her to many thousands of visitors. Hence in       this regard Emerald  Bay  Camp  is  ideal.   EAGLE  LAKE   From Emerald Bay Camp there are quite a number of interesting trail and climbing trips,       one of the commonest of which is that to Eagle Lake.   Taking the trail west, one zigzags to the north until the   226     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Automobile Boulevard is reached. A half mile's walk brings one to the bridge over Eagle       Creek. Here a few steps lead to the head of the upper portion of Eagle Falls, which dash       down a hundred feet or so to the rocky ledge, from whence they fall to their basin, ere       they flow out to join the waters of Emerald Bay.   A few yards beyond the bridge the trail starts. It is a genuine mountain trail, now over       rough jagged blocks of granite, then through groves of pines, firs, tamaracks and spruces,       where flowers, ferns, mosses and liverworts delight the eyes as they gaze down, and the       spiculae and cones and blue sky thrill one with delight as they look above, and where the       sunlight glitters through the trees as they look ahead. To the right Eagle Creek comes       noisily down, over falls and cascades, making its own music to the accompaniment of the       singing voices of the trees. Now and again the creek comes to a quiet, pastoral stretch,       where it becomes absolutely   still water.  Not that it is motionless, but noiseless,       covered over with trees and vines, that reflect upon its calm surface and half hide the       trout that float so easily and lazily through its clear, pure, cold stream.   There is enough of climbing to call into exercise long unused muscles, the granite blocks       are rough, angular and irregular enough to exercise eyes, hands and feet to keep one from       falling, and the lungs are filled with balsam-ladened mountain-air, fresh from God's own       perfect laboratories, healing, vivifying, rejuvenating, strengthening, while the heart is       helped on and encouraged to pump more and more of its blood, drawn from long almost       quiescent cells into the air-chambers of the lungs, there to receive the purifying and       life-giving oxygen and other chemical elements that multiply the leucocytes vastly and set       them at work driving out the disease germs that accumulate and linger in every city-living       man's and woman's system.   EMERALD BAY AND CAMP              227   Suddenly from a little rise the lake is revealed. Eagle Lake, or Pine Lake, or Spruce       Lake, or Hidden Lake, or Granite Lake, or Sheltered Lake     any of these names would be       appropriate. Almost circular in form     that is if you are not expected to be too rigidly       exact in geometric terms     it is literally a jewel of lapis lazuli in a setting of granite       cliffs.   Here one may sit and rest, enjoying the placid waters of the lake, the rugged grandeur of       the immediate cliffs, or the slopes of the towering mountains that encircle the horizon.   Eagle Lake is but one of the hundred of glacially made Sierran lakes of the Tahoe region,       but a study of its idiosyncrasies would reveal distinctive and charming characteristics.   CATHEDRAL   PEAK   There are two Cathedral Peaks at Tahoe, one above Cathedral Park on Fallen Leaf Lake, the       other at the rear of Emerald Bay Camp. Early in the season, 1914, three girls decided to       climb this peak from the camp although there was no trail. One of them wrote the following       account of the trip:   The most interesting peak of the Rubicon ridge is Cathedral. The mountain rises directly       back of Emerald Bay, some three thousand feet above the Lake. About six hundred feet above       the camp there is a meadow where larkspur grows four and five feet high. But from Eagle       Creek the aspect is quite different. There are no soft contours. Huge rocks pile up     one       great perpendicular surface adding five hundred feet to the height     into spires and domes       for all the world like some vast cathedral which taunts the soul with its aloofness. If,       on some sunshiny afternoon you look up from the camp and see a ghost-moon hanging, no more       than a foot above the highest spire, you must surely be  citified   if you do not pause to       drink in its weird sublimity and wild beauty.   Many winters of storm and snow have loosed the rocks      228     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   and carried them down the mountain. Those thrown down years ago are moss-covered and have       collected enough soil in their crevices to nourish underbrush and large trees. But there       are bare rocks along Eagle Creek to-day large enough for a man to hew a cabin from.       Standing in awe of their size one surely must look curiously up the mountain to find the       spaces they once occupied. Then, taking in the size of the peak it is equally natural that       one should be filled with a desire to climb it and look down the other side and across the       vista to the neighboring ranges. While we were getting used to the altitude we stood below       admiring. Every evening we went out on the wharf, gazed up at its grandeur and discussed       the best way to go, for though we knew we should have to break our own trail, we had       decided to attempt the climb. We set a day and the hour for rising; the night before laid       out our tramping clothes and religiously went to bed at eight. I doubt if any of us slept,       for we were used to later hours and excitement kept us awake.   As it was the first trip of the season, we lost some time at the start, admiring each       others' costumes. Two of us adhered to the regulation short skirt and bloomers, but the       third girl wore trousers, poked into the top of her high boots. This proved, by far, the       most satisfactory dress before the day's tramping was done. We got started at four-thirty.       The first awakened birds were twittering. The shadows of the moraine lay reflected in the       unruffled surface of the Bay. Gradually rosy flushes showed in the east. By the time we       reached the meadow the sun rose suddenly above the Nevada mountains and some of the chill       went out of the atmosphere.   The meadow was flooded with snow-water. Beyond, the mountain rose by sheer steps of rock       with slides of decomposed granite between. We avoided the under-brush as far as possible,       preferring to take back and forth across the loose granite. The wind came up as we left       the meadow, grew in force as we climbed. Some one suggested breakfast, and then there       began a search for a sheltered place. A spot sided by three bowlders away from under-brush       was decided upon.    By the time the fire was built the wind was   EMERALD BAY AND CAMP            229   a gale sending the flames leaping in every direction     up the rocks and up our arms as we       broiled the bacon. Breakfast was a failure, as far as comfort was concerned. It was a       relief when we finally tramped out the embers and resumed our journey.   The top of a long snow-drift was a previously chosen land-mark. It was seven when we       reached the top of it. Some one came out on the Bay in a row-boat     we were too high for       recognition     thought better of it and went back. Towards the top we left the decomposed       granite and underbrush behind, climbing the rocks in preference to the snow, where the       choice was allowed us. The wind howled and shrieked, and blew with a force great enough to       destroy balance, while its icy touch brought the blood tingling to our cheeks.   At last we reached the summit. And oh  the joy of achievement.   All Rubicon ridge and its neighbors, as far as the eye could see, were white with snow;       the lakes in the valley below were still frozen     only one showing any blue. Clouds came       up rapidly from the west, rushed by to the Nevada side where they piled up in great       cumulous heaps. The apex of Pyramid was cloud-capped all day. Shifting gusts drove the       waters of Tahoe scurrying first this way, then that. Where in the early morning every tree       had viewed her image among the reflected tints of sunrise, at ten-thirty white-caps       flashed and disappeared to flash in a different place among the everchanging eddies.       Cascade and Fallen Leaf Lakes presented a continuous procession of white-caps to the east,       while Eagle lay black and sinister in the shadow of Maggie's Peaks.   After lunch, the wind blowing too cold for comfort, we started home, straight down     over       snow, granite and underbrush     till we hit the State Highway. Here we found a sheltered       place by a creek and talked over the day's happenings.   Along the roadside we drew up a resolution on the satisfaction of the trip. The girl who       had been cold all day didn't ever want to see snow again, but already the others were       discussing a possible ascent from the Eagle Creek side     so great is the lure of the high       places.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXII   AL-TAHOE   AL-TAHOE, four miles east of Tallac, is one of the newer, better and more fashionable and pretentious resorts recently established at the south end of the Lake. Its projectors saw the increasing demand for summer residences on the Lake, and realizing to the full the superior advantages of this location, they divided their large holding into suitable villa and bungalow sites, and other lots, and readily disposed of a number of them to those who were ready to build. To further the colonizing plans of these chosen and selected purchasers a fine, modern, well-equipped hotel was erected, replete with every convenience and luxury that progressive Americans now expect and demand in their chosen resorts. The result is quite a settlement has grown up, and Al-Tahoe sees ahead an era of rapid growth and prosperity. Its homes are substantial and beautiful and indicate that John LeConte's prophecy, elsewhere quoted, is already coming to pass. Pasadena capitalists are behind the hotel and town project.   Being advantageously located on the State and National automobile boulevard, and near to all the choice mountain, lake and other resorts of the southern end of Tahoe, it appeals to those who wish to combine equally ready access to civilization with the wild ruggedness and infinite variety of many-featured Nature.   It is situated on a high plateau, gently sloping from the bluff, with a Lake-frontage of about three quarters of a   230   AL-TAHOE   231   mile. The land rises with a gentle slope to the edge of the terrace facing the stream, meadow, and mountains on the south.   With no stagnant water, there are practically no mosquitoes, and it is confessedly one of the most healthful spots of all this health giving region. Being on a lea shore, the cold air from the snowy summits of the mountains tempered by the warm soil of the foothills and level area, there is no place on the Lake better adapted for bathing and boating, especially as the beach is sandy and shallow, sloping off for some distance from the shore.   The accompanying photographs give some idea of the hotel and its cottages, together with some Al-Tahoe homes. The water supply for the town and hotel is gained from beautiful and pure Star Lake, 3000 feet higher than Lake Tahoe, and where snow may be seen during the entire year. The Al-Tahoe Company owns its own electric generating plant and supplies all the cottages with electric light.   The hotel itself is conducted on the American plan, and in every modern way meets the requirements of the most exacting patrons. Amusements of every kind are provided, and there is a good livery stable and automobile garage.   The town itself is being built up with a select class of summer residents. No saloons are allowed. There are still desirable lots for sale, and the Al-Tahoe Company, or L. H. Bannister, the Postmaster, will be glad to correspond with any who contemplate purchasing or building. Letters may be addressed to either at Al-Tahoe, Lake Tahoe, Calif.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXIII   GLEN  ALPINE  SPRINGS   THE earliest of all the resorts of the Tahoe region away from the shores of Tahoe itself,       Glen Alpine Springs still retains its natural supremacy.    Located seven miles away from       Tallac, reached by excellent roads in automobile stages, sequestered and sheltered, yet       absolutely in the very heart of the most interesting part of the Tahoe region, scenically       and geologically, it continues to attract an increasing number of the better class of       guests that annually visit these divinely-favored California Sierras. John Muir wrote       truthfully when he said:   The Glen Alpine Springs tourist resort seems to me one of the most delightful places in       all the famous Tahoe region. From no other valley, as far as I know, may excursions be       made in a single day to so many peaks, wild gardens, glacier lakes, glacier meadows, and       Alpine groves, cascades, etc.   The drive from Tallac around Fallen Leaf Lake under trees whose boles form arch or portal,       framing pictures of the sunny lake, is a memorable experience; then on past Glen Alpine       Falls, Lily Lake, and Modjeska Falls, up the deep mountain glen, where the road ends at       the hospitable cottages, log-houses and spacious tents of Glen Alpine.   Here is the world-famous spring, discovered in the 'fifties by Nathan Gilmore (for whom       Gilmore Lake is named). Mr. Gilmore was born in Ohio, but, when a mere youth, instead of       attending college and graduating in law as his   232   MOUNT TALLAC, RUBICON PEAKS, ETC., FROM LONG WHARF AT AL TAHOE, LAKE TAHOE   AL TAHOE INN AND COTTAGES, ON LAKE TAHOE      MURPHEY COTTAGE, AL TAHOE, ON  LAKE TAHOE   PORTERFIELD COTTAGE, AL TAHOE, ON  LAKE TAHOE   GLEN ALPINE SPRINGS   233   parents had arranged for and expected, he yielded to the lure of the California gold       excitement, came West, and in 1850 found himself in Placerville. In due time he married,       and to the sickness of his daughter Evelyn, now Mrs. John L. Ramsay, of Freewater, Ore.,       is owing his discovery of Glen Alpine. The doctor ordered him to bring the child up into       the mountains. Accompanied by an old friend, Barton Richardson, of the James Barton Key       family of Philadelphia, he came up to Tallac, with the ailing child and its mother. Being       of active temperament he and Mr. Richardson scaled Mt. Tallac, and in returning were much       entranced by Fallen Leaf Lake. Later Mr. Gilmore came to Fallen Leaf alone, wandering over       its moraines and lingering by its shores to drink in its impressive and       growingly-overpowering beauty. In those days there was no road at the southern end of       Fallen Leaf and the interested explorer was perforce led to follow the trails of bear,       deer and other wild animals. Rambling through the woods, some two miles above the lake he       came to a willow-surrounded swampy place, where the logs and fallen trees were clearly       worn by the footprints of many generations of wild animals. Prompted by curiosity he       followed the hidden trail, saw where a small stream of mineral-stained water was flowing,       observed where the deer, etc., had licked the stones, and finally came to the source in       what he afterwards called Glen Alpine Springs. Scientific observation afterwards showed       that the water had an almost uniform temperature, even in the hottest days of summer, of       39.6 degrees Fahr., and that there was free carbonic acid gas to the extent of 138.36       cubic inches. The analysis revealed that each U. S. gallon contained grains as follows:   Sodium Chloride ... 21.17 Sodium Carbonate .. 32.75 Potassium    Carbonate Trace   Ferrous Carbonate ..    1.8   Alumnia   ..........     1.43   Borates      .........Trace   234     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Magnesium Carbonate    9.96    Silica............    2.50   Calcium  Carbonate..  45.09    Organic Matter .... Trace   Calcium  Sulphate   ..    4.10                                    ---------   Total Solids.......118.80   The water is pleasant to the taste, and, as has been shown, highly charged with carbonic       acid gas; its action is diuretic, laxative and stimulative to the entire digestive tract.       Eminent physicians claim that it is beneficial in dyspepsia, torpid liver, kidney and       bladder irritation, and is also a tonic.   Whether this be true or not I cannot say, but I do know that every time I go to Glen       Alpine I drink freely and abundantly of the water, to my great physical pleasure and       satisfaction. It is one of the most delicious sparkling waters I have ever tasted, as       gratifying to the palate and soothing to the fevered mucous membranes as Apollinaris or       Shasta Water, and I am not alone in the wish I often express, viz., that I might have such       a spring in my backyard at home.   One result of this discovery was that Mr. Gilmore decided to locate upon the land. As soon       as the first claim was made secure a rude one-roomed cabin was built and Mr. Richardson       was the first guest. Preparatory to bringing his family, Mr. Gilmore added two more rooms,       and to render ingress easier he built a road to intersect with the Tallac road at the       northern end of Fallen Leaf Lake. As this had to be blasted out with black powder,    it was       before the days of dynamite,    Mr. Gilmore's devotion to the place can be well understood.   When his daughters grew up, they and their friends came here to spend their summers, and       by and by, almost uncon-ciously, but pleasantly and agreeably, the place became a public       resort. Though Mr. Gilmore has long since passed on, having died in Placerville, Calif.,       in the year 1898, Glen   GLEN ALPINE SPRINGS   235   Alpine Springs is still in the ownership of his family, and its management and direction       is entirely in their hands.   As in the beginning they have ever sought to preserve its character of simplicity. It is       their aim that everything should be as primitive as possible, consonant with       healthful-ness, privacy and comfort. While no sanitary precautions are neglected, and       water, hot and cold, is extravagantly provided, with free shower baths, there are none of       the frills and furbelows that generally convert these     what should be     simple nature       resorts into bad imitations of the luxurious hotels of the city. There are positively no       dress events. Men and women are urged to bring their old clothes and wear them out here,       or provide only khaki or corduroy, with short skirts, bloomers and leggings for the fair       sex. Strong shoes are required; hob-nailed if one expects to do any climbing. Wraps for       evening, and heavy underwear for an unusual day (storms sometimes come in Sierran regions        unexpectedly),   are  sensible  precautions.   Sleeping out-of-doors is one of the features of the place, an invigorating, rejuvenating       joy, which Mark Twain affirmed was able to destroy any amount of fatigue that a person's       body could gather. Visitors are given their choice of a comfortable bed in the open, in a       cottage, tent, or one of the main buildings. There are practically no rules at Glen Alpine       save those that would operate in any respectable home. No liquors are sold, and visitors       are frankly told that   If they must have liquid stimulants they must bring them along.        In order that those who desire to sleep may not be disturbed by the thoughtlessness of       others, music is prohibited after ten o'clock. One of the delights of the place is the       nightly camp-fire. Here is a large open space, close to the spring, surrounded by       commodious and comfortable canvas seats, that will easily hold eight or ten persons,  the       blazing fire is started every evening.    Those   236     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   who have musical instruments     guitars, banjos, mandolins, flutes, cornets, violins, and       even the plebeian accordion or the modest Jew's-harp     are requested to bring them. Solos,       choruses, hymns and college songs are indulged in to the heart's content. Now and again       dances are given, and when any speaker arrives who is willing to entertain the guests, a       talk, lecture or sermon is arranged for.   Three things are never found at Glen Alpine. These are poison-oak, rattlesnakes and       poisonous insects. The rowdy, gambling and carousing element are equally absent, for       should they ever appear, they speedily discover their lack of harmony and voluntarily       retire.   While the Glen Alpine resort is not situated directly on one of the lakes, it owns over       twenty boats on eight of the nearby lakes, and the use of these is freely accorded to its       guests. That it is in close proximity to lakes and peaks is evidenced by the following       table, which gives the distance in miles from the hotel:   Miles           Miles    2 1/2 Angora Lake   3 1/2 Gilmore Lake   4 American Lake   3 1/4 Heather Lake   6 Avalanche Lake   3 1/4 Half Moon Lake   3 1/4 Alta Morris Lak   5 Kalmia Lake   7 Azure Lake   1 Lily Lake   5 Center Lake   2 1/4 Lucile  Lake   5 1/2 Crystal Lake   3 3/4 LeConte Lake   5 3/4 Crater  Lake   2 1/2 Margery Lake   6 Cup Lake   1/4 Modjeska Falls   4 3/4 Cathedral Lake   3 1/2 Observation  Point   5 1/2 Echo Lake   4 1/4 Olney Lake   2 Fallen Leaf Lak   4 1/4 Pit Lake   5 1/4 Floating Island Lake 6 Pyramid Lake   4 1/4 Forest Lake   4 3/4 Rainbow Lake   6 Fontinalis  Lake  2 3/4 Susie Lake   1 1/4 Glen Alpine Falls 3 1/2 Susie Lake Falls   1 1/4 Grass Lake   2 3/4 Summit Lake   4 3/4 Grouse Lake   6 Snow Lake   GLEN ALPINE FALLS   CLUSTER OF TENTS, GLEN ALPINE SPRINGS   GLEN ALPINE SPRINGS   237   Miles  Miles    4 1/2 Tamarack Lake   2 1/2 Keiths Dome   6 Tallac Lake   7 Pyramid   Peak   7 Tahoe Lake   6 1/2 Ralston Peak   6 1/2 Velma Lakes   3 3/4 Richardsons Peak    Woods, Lake of the 5 Upper Truckee River   3 1/4 Angora Peak   4 3/4 Mt. Tallac   5 1/4 Dicks Peak   7 Mt. Agassiz   5 1/2 Jacks Peak   3 Cracked Crag   As the proprietors of Glen Alpine ask:   Where else outside of Switzerland is there a like       region of lakes (forty-odd) and world of Sierran grandeur, such air with the tonic of       altitude, mineral-spring water, trout-fishing, and camaraderie of kindred spirits     While the foregoing list gives a comprehensive suggestion of the wide reach of Glen       Alpine's territory there are several especial peaks and lakes that are peculiarly its own.       These are Pyramid, Agassiz, Dicks, Jacks, Richardsons, Ralston, and the Angora Peaks,       Mount Tallac, Mosquito Pass, and Lakes Olney, LeConte, Heather, Susie, Grass, Lucile,       Margery, and Summit with Lake of the Woods and others in Desolation Valley, Gilmore, Half       Moon, Alta, Morris, Lily, Tamarack, Rainbow, Grouse, and the Upper and Lower Echo.       Desolation Valley and all its surroundings is also within close reach. This is some four       miles westward of Glen Alpine Springs, and is reached by way of easy mountain trails under       sweet-scented pines and gnarled old junipers; besides singing streams; across crystal       lakes, through a cliff-guarded glade where snowbanks linger until midsummer, ever renewing       the carpet of green, decking it with heather and myriad exquisite mountain blossoms. On,       over a granite embankment, and lo  your feet are stayed and your heart is stilled as your       eyes behold marvelous Desolation Valley. Greeting you on its southern boundary stands         majestic   Pyramid   Peak,   with   its   eternal   snows.   238     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Lofty companions circling to your very feet make the walls forming the granite cradle of       Olney, the Lake of Mazes. The waters are blue as the skies above them, and pure as the       melting snows from Pyramid which form them. He who has not looked upon this, the most       remarkable of all the wonder pictures in the Tahoe region, has missed that for which there       is no substitute.   The whole Glen Alpine basin,    which practically extends from the Tallac range on the       north, from Heather Lake Pass (the outlet from Desolation Valley) and Cracked Crag on the       west and southwest, Ralston Peak and range to the south and the Angora Peaks on the east,           is one mass of glacial scoriations. Within a few stone-throws of the spring, on a       little-used trail to Grass Lake, there are several beautiful and interesting markings. One       of these is a finely defined curve or groove, extending for ioo feet or more, above which,       about i  feet, is another groove, some two to four feet wide. These run rudely parallel       for some distance, then unite and continue as one. Coming back to the trail     a hundred or       so feet away,    on the left hand side returning to the spring, is a gigantic sloping       granite block, perfectly polished with glacial action, and black as though its surface had       been coated in the process. Near here the trail ducks or markers are placed in a deep       grooving or trough three or four feet wide, and of equal depth, while to the right are two       other similar troughs working their winding and tortuous way into the valley beneath.   In Chapter VIII an idea is given of the movements of the great glaciers that formed       Desolation Valley and all the nearby lakes, as well as Glen Alpine basin. These gigantic       ice-sheets, with their firmly-wedged carving blocks of granite, moved over the Heather       Lake Pass, gouging out that lake, and Susie Lake, in its onward march, and then,   GLEN ALPINE SPRINGS                 239   added to by glacial flows from Cracked Crag, the southern slopes of the Tallac range, and       the Angora Peaks, it passed on and down, shaping this interestingly rugged, wild and       picturesque basin as we find it to-day. How many centuries of cutting and gouging,       beveling and grooving were required to accomplish this, who can tell? Never resting, never       halting, ever moving, irresistibly cutting, carving, grinding and demolishing, it carried       away its millions of millions of tons or rocky debris in bowlders, pebbles, sand and mud,       and thus helped make the gigantic moraines of Fallen Leaf Lake. The ice-flow itself passed       along over where the terminal moraine now stands, cutting out Fallen Leaf Lake basin in       its movement, and finally rested in the vast bowl of Lake Tahoe.   To the careful student every foot of Glen Alpine basin is worthy of study, and he who       desires to further the cause of science will do well to make a map of his observations,       recording the direction, appearance, depth, length and width of all the glacial markings       he discovers. On the U. S. Government maps the stream flowing through Glen Alpine basin is       marked as Eau Claire Creek. To the proprietors of Glen Alpine, and the visitors, the       French name is absurd and out of place. No Frenchman has ever resided here, and if it was       desired to call it Clear Water Creek, why not use good, understandable, common-sense       English. At the request of those most intimately concerned, therefore, the name has been       changed on the map that accompanies this volume, to Glen Alpine Creek, a name that         belongs   and to which no one can possibly have any objection.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXIV   FALLEN   LEAF  LAKE  AND  ITS  RESORTS   FALLEN LEAF LAKE is a noble body of water, three and a half miles long and about one mile       across. Why it is called Fallen Leaf is fully explained in the chapter on Indian Legends.       Some people have thought it was named from its shape, but this cannot be, for, from the       summit of Mt. Tallac, every one instantly notices its resemblance to the imprint of a       human foot. It is shaped more like a cork-sole, as if cut out of the solid rock, filled up       with a rich indigo-blue fluid, and then made extra beautiful and secluded with a rich tree       and plant growth on every slope that surrounds it.   The color of the water is as richly blue as is Tahoe itself, and there is the same       suggestion of an emerald ring around it, as in the larger Lake, though this ring is       neither so wide nor so highly colored.   In elevation it is some 80 feet above Lake Tahoe, thus giving it an altitude of 6300 feet.   At the upper end, near Fallen Leaf Lodge, under the cliffs it has a depth of over 380       feet, but it becomes much shallower at the northern or lower end near the outlet. Its       surroundings are majestic and enthralling as well as picturesque and alluring. On the west       Mt. Tallac towers its nearly 10,000 feet into the sea of the upper air, flanked on the       south by the lesser noble and majestic Cathedral Peak. In the earlier part of the season       when these are covered with snow, the pure white materially enhances the splendor   240   GLEN ALPINE FALLS   GLIMPSE OF GRASS LAKE, LOOKING ACROSS AND UP GLEN ALPINE CANYON   THE TRIUMPHANT ANGLER, LAKE TAHOE   FALLEN LEAF LAKE AND ITS RESORTS      241   of both mountain and lake by enriching their varied colorings with the marked contrast.   To the southwest rise the Angora Peaks, and these likewise catch, and hold the winter's       snow, often, like Mt. Tal-lac, retaining beds of neve from year to year.   To the geological student, especially one interested in glacial phenomena, the lateral and       terminal moraines of Fallen Leaf Lake are of marked and unusual interest. The moraine on       the east is upwards of 1000 feet high, and is a majestic ridge, clothed from the lake       shore to its summit with a rich growth of pines, firs and hemlocks. Its great height and       bulk will suggest to the thoughtful reader the questions as to how it was formed, and       whence came all the material of its manufacture. It extends nearly the whole length  i the       lake, diminishing somewhat in size at the northern end. There is a corresponding moraine       on the western side not less compelling in its interest though scarcely as large in size       as its eastern counterpart. The terminal moraine, which is the one that closed up the       lake, separating and raising it above the level of Lake Tahoe, is a less noble mound, yet       geologically it allures the mind and demands study as much as the others. In Chapter VIII,       Dr. Joseph LeConte's theories are given in full explaining the various glacial phenomena       connected with this lake.   The fish of Fallen Leaf are practically the same as those of Tahoe, though rod and fly       fishing is more indulged in here.   Boating, canoeing and the use of the motor boat are daily recreations, and swimming is       regularly indulged in during the summer season.   FALLEN   LEAF  LODGE   The distinguishing characteristics of this resort are simplicity,   home-likeness,         unostentation.    It  makes  its  appeal   242      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   especially to the thoughtful and the studious, the not luxuriously rich, those who love       Nature rather than the elegance of a first-class hotel, and who desire to climb trails,       study trees, hunt, fish, and generally recreate out-of-doors rather than dress and fare       sumptuously.   It is situated on the southwestern edge of Fallen Leaf Lake, five miles from Tallac,       reached by a road that winds through the trees of the Baldwin estate, and then skirts the       eastern and southern shores of the Lake. Stages     horse and automobile     run daily during       the season and meet all the steamers at Tallac.   The   Lodge   consists of a number of detached buildings, conveniently and picturesquely       scattered among the pines on the slopes and at the edge of the lake. There are dining       hall, social hall, post office, store, electric power-house, boat-house, with stables far       enough away to be sanitary, and cottages and tents located in every suitable nook that can       be found. There are one, two or three-roomed cottages, tents, single and double, all in       genuine camp style. There is no elegance or luxury, though most of the cottages have       modern toilets, porcelain bath-tubs with running hot and cold water.    Electric lights       are everywhere.   The camp has been in existence now (1915) for seven years and each year has seen       considerable enlargement and improvement, until now Fallen Leaf Lodge in the heart of the       summer season is an active, busy, happy and home-like community.   The table is wholesome, substantial and appetizing. There is no pretense at elaborateness.       Home-cooking, well served, of simple and healthful dishes, in reasonable variety, is all       that is offered.   Needless to say there is no bar or saloon, though there is no attempt to compel a personal       standpoint on the liquor   FALLEN LEAF LAKE AND ITS RESORTS     243   question upon those who are accustomed to the use of alcoholic liquors at meals.   In its natural beauties and advantages Fallen Leaf Lodge claims     and with strong       justification     one of the very best of locations. Fallen Leaf Lake is large enough to       give scope to all the motor-boats, row-boats, canoes and launches that are likely to be       brought to it for the next hundred years, and ten thousand fishermen could successfully       angle upon its bosom or along its shores. For millions of Tahoe trout, rainbow, Eastern       brook, Loch Levin, Mackinac and German brown have been put into this and nearby lakes in       the last few years. While some jerk-line fishing is indulged in, this lake, unlike Lake       Tahoe, affords constant recreation for the more sportsmanlike fly-fishing.   Another of the special advantages of Fallen Leaf Lodge is its possession of a fine       log-house and camp on the shore of Lake of the Woods, five miles away, in Desolation       Valley. To those who wish to fish in greater solitude, to climb the peaks of the Crystal       Range, or boat over the many and various lakes of Desolation Valley this is a great       convenience.   Nothing can surpass the calm grandeur of the setting of this glorious beautiful water.       Lying at the lower edge of Desolation Valley and facing stupendous mountains, the picture       it presents, with Pyramid Peak reflected in its gorgeously lit-up sunset waters, is one       that will forever linger in the memory.   The close proximity of Fallen Leaf Lodge to Mt. Tal-lac, Cathedral Peak, the Angora Peaks,       Mounts Jack, Dick, and Richardson, Ralston Peak, Keith's Dome, Maggie's Peaks, Tell's       Peak, with the towering peaks of the Crystal Range     Pyramid and Agassiz     to the west,       and Freel's, Job's and Job's Sister to the southeast, afford an abundance   244     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   and variety of mountain-climbing that are seldom found in any region, however favored.   But in addition to the peaks there are Sierran lakes galore, rich in unusual beauty and       picturesqueness, and most of them stocked with trout that compel the exertion of the       angler's skill, as much as tickle the palate of the uncor-rupted epicure. Close by are       Cascade, Cathedral, Floating Island, Echo, Heather, Lucile, Margery, Gilmore, Le Conte,       Lily, Susie, Tamarack, Grouse, Lake of the Woods, Avalanche, Pit, Crystal, Pyramid, Half       Moon, with the marvelous and alluring maze of lakes, bays, straits, channels, inlets and         blind alleys   of the Lake Olney of the ever-fascinating Desolation Valley. And those I       have named are all within comparatively easy walking distance to the ordinarily healthful       and vigorous man or woman. For those who seek more strenuous exercise, or desire       horse-back or camping-out trips another twenty, aye fifty lakes, within a radius of fifty       miles may be found, with their connecting creeks, streams and rivers where gamey trout       abound, and where flowers, shrubs and trees in never-ceasing variety and charm tempt the       botanist and nature-lover.   While to some it may not be an attraction, to others there may be both pleasure and       interest in witnessing the operations of the Fallen Leaf sawmill. This is situated on the       western side of the lake, and is a scene of activity and bustle when logging and lumbering       are in progress. On the hills about the lake the   fellers   may be found, chopping their       way into the hearts of the forest monarchs of pine, fir and cedar, and then inserting the       saw, whose biting teeth soon cut from rim to rim and cause the crashing downfall of trees       that have stood for centuries. Denuded of their limbs these are then sawn into appropriate       lengths,   snaked   by chains pulled by powerful horses to the   chute,  down which they       are shot into the lake, from whence they are easily towed to      BOATING ON FALLEN LEAF LAKE   FALLEN LEAF LODGE AMONG THE PINES, ON FALLEN LEAF   LAKE   Camp Agassiz Boys setting out for A Trip, Lake Tahoe, Cal.   Copyright  1910, by  Harold A.   Parker.   TAHOE MEADOWS, WITH MT. TALLAC IN THE DISTANCE   FALLEN LEAF LAKE AND ITS RESORTS      245   the mill. The chute consists of felled logs, laid side by side, evenly and regularly, so       as to form a continuous trough. This is greased, so that when the heavy logs are placed       therein they slide of their own weight, where there is a declivity, and are easily dragged       or propelled on the level ground.   I use the word propelled to suggest the interesting method used in these chutes. Sometimes       ten or a dozen logs will be placed, following each other, a few feet apart, on the trough       (the chute). A chain is fastened to the rear end of the hindermost log. This chain is       attached to a single-tree fastened to a horse's harness. The horse is started. This makes       the hinder log strike the next one, this bumps into the third and gives it a start, in its       turn it bumps the fourth, the fourth the fifth, and so on, until the whole dozen are in       motion. Had the string of logs been fastened together, the horse would have found it       impossible to move them, but   propelling   them in this fashion they are all set in       motion, and their inertia once overcome there is no difficulty experienced in keeping them       going.   The views from Fallen Leaf Lodge are varied and beautiful, one in particular being       especially enchanting. Over the Terminal moraine, across the hidden face of Lake Tahoe,       the eye falls upon the mountains in Nevada, on the far-away eastern side. In the soft       light of evening they look like fairy mountains, not real rocky masses of gigantic, rugged       substance, but something painted upon the horizon with delicate ringers, and in tints and       shades to correspond, for they look tenderer and sweeter, gentler and lovelier than       anything man could conceive or execute.   The owner of Fallen Leaf Lodge is Professor William W. Price, a graduate of Stanford       University, who first came into this region to study and catch special Sierran birds and       other fauna for the Smithsonian Institution, the American   246     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Museum of Natural History, and the British Museum. Later, when he founded the Agassiz       school for boys, at Auburn, California, he established Camp Agassiz near Fallen Leaf Lake,       in a grove of pines, firs, and cedars. Assisted by other university men he made of this an       ideal open-air school and camp for boys. They were taught such practical things as to take       care of themselves in the mountains, find a trail, or go to a given spot without a trail,       fish, hunt, make camp, build fires in a rain-storm, find proper shelter during a       lightning-storm, carry a pack, pack a mule or burro, even to the throwing of the   diamond       hitch,  the   squaw hitch,  and the   square   or other packer's especial   knots   and         ties.  They were induced to climb mountains, row, swim,   ski,  and snow-slide, and all       were taught to recognize at sight the common birds, smaller wild animals, trees, and       flowers. Frequent camping-out trips were arranged for, and the youngsters thus gained       health, vigor and permanent strength while doing what they all enjoyed doing.   In due time the parents wished to share the fun, joy, and out-of-door experiences of their       youngsters; then the friends, and those who heard about them, and out of the numerous       requests for accommodations Fallen Leaf Lodge was born. For a time Mr. Price tried an       ordinary hotel manager, but the peculiar and individualistic needs of his peculiar and       individualistic camp at length led Mrs. Price and himself to take the complete control.       From that time its success has been continuous.   Mr. Price is a scientific expert upon the flora (especially the trees), the birds and the       four-footed fauna of the whole region, and his readiness and willingness to communicate       his knowledge to his guests is a great advantage to the studious and inquiring.   Owing to the demands made upon his time by the management of Fallen Leaf Lodge Mr. Price       has transferred   FALLEN LEAF LAKE AND ITS RESORTS     247   his school into other hands, and has given up the Boys' Camp, though the lads are still       welcome, with their parents, as regular guests at the Lodge.   It should be noted that Fallen Leaf Lodge is but two miles from Glen Alpine Springs and       that all that is said of the close proximity of the most interesting features of the       southern end of the Lake Tahoe region to Glen Alpine, applies with equal force (plus the       two miles) to Fallen Leaf Lodge.   CATHEDRAL   PARK  ON   FALLEN   LEAF   LAKE   One of the newest of the Tahoe region resorts is that of Cathedral Park, located on the       western side of Fallen Leaf Lake. It was opened in the latter part of the season of 1912       by Carl Fluegge. Everything about it is new, from the flooring of the tents to the fine       dining-room, cottages and stables. A special road has been constructed on the west side of       the lake, over which Cathedral Park stages run daily the three and a half miles, to meet       every steamer during the season at Tallac.   Rising directly from the edge of the lake, surrounded by majestic trees, protected by the       gigantic height of Mt. Tallac (9785 feet) from the western winds, a clear open view of       Fallen Leaf Lake and the thousand-feet high lateral moraine on the eastern side is       obtained; there could be no better location for such a resort.   The distinctive features of Cathedral Park are simplicity and home-comforts, with special       advantages for hunting, fishing and camping out. For ten years Mr. Fluegge has taken out       some of the most distinguished patrons of the Tahoe region in his capacity as expert guide       and huntsman. He knows every trail thoroughly and has scaled every mountain of the       surrounding country. He knows the habits and haunts of bear, deer, and other game, and is       a successful   248     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   hunter of them, as well as of grouse and quail. His office and social-hall bear practical       evidence of his prowess and skill in the mounted heads of deer, and the dressed skins of       bear that he has shot. He is also an expert angler, and well acquainted with the best       fishing in Granite, Eagle, the Rock-Bound, Gilmore and other lakes, as well as those       closer at hand. There are twelve such lakes within easy reach of Cathedral Park. Fishing       and hunting are his hobbies and delights, hence he makes a thoroughly competent, because       interested, and interesting guide. Nothing pleases him more than to get out with his       guests and assist them in their angling and hunting. To aid in this he has established his       own permanent camp at the beautiful Angora Lakes, four miles from Cathedral Park, which is       placed freely at the disposal of his guests.   Especial arrangements are made for the perfect and satisfactory accommodation of guests       who desire to sleep out of doors. Tents, sleeping porches and platforms are arranged with       a view to the strictest privacy, and those who desire this healthful open-air mode of life       can nowhere be better accommodated than here. As Mark Twain has said, it is the   open air         sleeping in the Lake Tahoe region that is so beneficial. Again to quote him:   The air       up there in the clouds is very pure and fine, bracing and delicious. And why shouldn't it       be?     it is the same the angels breathe. I think that hardly any amount of fatigue can be       gathered together that a man cannot sleep off in one night here. Not under a roof, but       under the sky.  Therefore Cathedral Park says to those who wish to breathe the same air as       the angels while they are yet on the earth: Come to us and we will meet your reasonable       wishes in every possible way.   The presence of Mrs. Fluegge, who is associated with her husband in the management,       guarantees to ladies, whether   PICTURESQUE PALO ALTO LODGE AT LAKESIDE PARK, LAKE TAHOE      THE LONG WHARF AT LAKESIDE PARK, LAKE TAIIOE   AUTOMOBILING  ROAD AROUND CAVE ROCK, LAKE TAHOE   FALLEN LEAF LAKE AND ITS RESORTS    ' 249   unaccompanied, or with their families, the best of care, and the former are especially       invited to come and test the homelike qualities of the place.   The water supply of Cathedral Park is gained from its own springs, on the mountain side       above the resort. It is piped down to every tent or cottage and the supply is       superabundant. Fish are caught almo6t daily on the landing in front of the hotel. Fallen       Leaf is an ideal spot for rowing, canoeing, and launch rides, and the hotel owns its own       launch in which parties are regularly taken around the lake. During the summer season       bathing is as delightful here as in any of the seaside resorts of the Atlantic and       Pacific, and almost every one takes a plunge daily.   A camp-fire is built every night, where singing, storytelling, and open air amusements of       an impromptu nature are indulged in to one's heart's content, though visitors are all       expected to remember the rights of others and not keep too late hours.   Informal dances are indulged in occasionally and everything is done to promote the       comfort, pleasure and enjoyment of the guests that earnest desire, constant watchfulness       and long experience can suggest.   The table is simple and homelike, but abundant, well-served and satisfactory. This       department is entirely under the control of Mrs. Fluegge, who never employs any other than       white help in the kitchen. Fresh fruit and vegetables, lake trout and game in season,       fresh milk and cream, with everything of the best that the markets afford, are none too       good for the guests at Cathedral Park.   Unlike most of the Lake Tahoe resorts, it keeps open throughout the whole year, and is       managed with but one idea, viz., to give absolute and complete satisfaction to all its       guests.   250     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Its rates are reasonable, and especial prices are given to children under ten years of age       and to families who wish to stay for any length of time.   The short trail to Mount Tallac rises directly from Cathedral Park, and all that has been       said of the close proximity of Glen Alpine and Fallen Leaf Lodge to the most interesting       peaks, lakes, etc., of the Tahoe region applies with equal force to Cathedral Park, plus       the short additional distance, which is something less than a mile.   Mr. Fluegge will be glad to correspond with those contemplating a visit to Cathedral Park,       especially should they desire his services for hunting, fishing, or camping-out trips of a       few days or a month's duration. The address is Cathedral Park, Tallac P. O., Lake Tahoe,       California.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXV   LAKESIDE   PARK   SITUATED on the shore of Lake Tahoe and at the same time on the great Lincoln Highway stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific,    a division of the State Automobile Highway reaching from Sacramento, California, to Carson City, Nevada, via Placerville, Lakeside Park is readily reached by travelers from every direction, whether they come by steamer, buggy, or automobile.   The Lakeside Park hotel was established in 1892 and has an enviable reputation. It consists of hotel, with adjacent cottages and tents, comfortably furnished and equipped with every healthful necessity. Here surrounded by beautiful trees, that sing sweet songs to the touch of the winds, drinking in health and vigor from their balsamic odors, enjoying the invigorating sunshine and the purifying breezes coming from mountain, forest and Lake, swimming in the Lake, rowing, canoeing, climbing mountain trails, exploring rocky and wooded canyons, fishing, hunting, botanizing, studying geology in one of the most wonderful volumes Nature has ever written, sleeping out-of-doors under the trees and the glowing stars after being lulled to rest by the soothing lappings of the gentle waves upon the beach     who can conceive a more ideal vacation-time than this.   Unlike many parts of Lake Tahoe, Lakeside Park possesses a fine stretch of beautiful, clean, sandy beach. There are no rocks, deep holes, tide or undertow.    Children can wade,   251   252     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   bathe or swim in perfect safety as the shore gradually slopes into deeper water.   The whole settlement is abundantly supplied with purest spring water which is piped down from its source high on the mountain slopes to the south. The hotel is fully equipped with hot and cold water for baths and all other needed purposes, and there is a good store, well stocked livery stable, row-boats, steam laundry and home dairy.   The store carries a very complete line of provisions and supplies, fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy-produce, ice, hay, grain, lumber, shingles, stove-wood, paints, gasoline     in fact, everything that is likely to be in demand in such a community. Camp-fire wood is abundant and free to patrons. This is particularly advantageous for those who wish to tent and   board themselves.  Housekeeping tents are provided, on platforms in the grove, at reasonable rates, and the hotel owns its pasture in which the horses of patrons are cared for free of charge.   The location of Lakeside Park in relation to Lake Tahoe is peculiarly advantageous in that it affords daily opportunity for driving, horseback-riding or walking directly along the shore for miles. Indeed the twelve mile drive to Glenbrook is one of the noted drives of the world, taking in the celebrated Cave Rock, and giving the widest possible outlooks of the whole expanse of the Lake.   Patrons of the hotel or camps are assured that there are no rattlesnakes, fleas, malaria, fogs, or poison oak. The character and tone of the place will also be recognized when it is known that saloons and gambling resorts are absolutely prohibited in the residential tract.   The most majestic of all the mountains of Lake Tahoe are closely adjacent to Lakeside Park. Mt. Sinclair, 9500 feet, rises immediately from the eastern boundary, whilst Monument Peak, Mounts Freel, Job, and Job's Sister, rang-   LAKESIDE PARK                      253   ing from 10,000 to 11,200 feet above sea level are close by. Such near proximity to these mountains gives unequalled opportunities for tramping, riding and driving through and over marvelous diversity of hill, valley, woodland, canyon and mountain. Scores of miles of mountain trails remain to be thoroughly explored and to the hunter these highest mountains are the most alluring spots of the whole Tahoe Region.   Yet while these mountains are close by Lakeside Park is near enough to Fallen Leaf Lake, Glen Alpine Springs and Desolation Valley to give fullest opportunity for trips to these noted spots and their adjacent attractions.   In addition it allows ready incursions into Nevada, where the prehistoric footprints at Carson City, the marvelous Steamboat Springs, and the world-famed mines and Sutro Tunnel of Virginia City have been a lure for many thousands during the past decades. It is also near to Hope Valley and the peak on which Fremont climbed when, in 1844, he discovered and first described Lake Tahoe, and is the natural stopping-place for those who wish to go over the road the Pathfinder made, accompanied by Kit Carson, his guide and scout, whose name is retained in Carson City, Carson Tree, Carson Valley and Carson Canyon, all of which are within a day's easy ride.   PRIVATE  RESIDENCES  AT  LAKESIDE  PARK   To meet the ever-increasing demand for lots on which to build summer homes on Lake Tahoe the Lakeside Park Company has set aside a limited and desirable portion of its large property on the southeasterly shore of Lake Tahoe for cottages and log cabins, bungalows and lodges, or acre tracts for chalets and villas. Already quite a number have availed themselves of this privilege and a colony of beautiful homes is being established.    Mr. and Mrs. Hill, with a   254     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   keen eye for the appropriate, and at the same time wishful to show how a most perfect bungalow can be constructed at a remarkably low price, have planned and erected several most attractive   specimens  or   models,  at prices ranging from  450 to  1000 and over. The fact that the tract is so located in an actual, not merely a nominal, wooded park, where pines, firs, tamaracks and other Sierran trees abound, allow the proprietors to offer fine logs for cabins and rustic-work in almost unlimited quantities, and in the granite-ribbed mountains close by is a quarry from which rock for foundations, chimneys and open fireplaces may be taken without stint. These are great advantages not to be ignored by those who desire to build, and those who are first on the scene naturally will be accorded the first choice both of lots and material.   There is but one Lake Tahoe in America, and as the men of California and Nevada cities find more time for leisure it will not be many years before every available spot will be purchased and summer residences abound, just as is the case in the noted eastern lakes, or those near to such cities as Minneapolis, etc., in the middle west.   In setting aside this residential section at Lakeside Park the owners have planned with far-sighted and generous liberality. The Lake frontage is reserved for general use of the hotel guests and cottage community, so there will be no conflict regarding privileges of boating, bathing, fishing, and   rest cure   on the beach. Another wise provision is that a generous portion of the amounts received from early sales of lots is being devoted to general improvements that are for mutual benefit; such as the extension of roads, paths, trails and water-pipes, a substantial breakwater for better protection of launches and boats, larger dancing-pavilion or platform, automobile garage, more dressing rooms for bathers, etc.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXVI   GLENBROOK  AND  MARLETTE  LAKE   IN Chapter XVI the history of Glenbrook is given in some detail. It is now, however, converted into a pleasure resort especially popular with residents of Nevada, and largely used by automobiles crossing the Sierras and passing around Lake Tahoe.   The Inn, and its veranda overlooking the Lake, is built with an eye to comfort and convenience. Every need for pleasure and recreation is arranged for. For those who enjoy privacy, cosy cottages are provided, around which beautiful wild flowers grow in wonderful profusion. The guests here are especially favored in that the Inn has its own ranch, dairy, poultry farm, fruit orchard and vegetable garden. The table, therefore, is abundantly provided, and everything is of known quality and brought in fresh daily.   Glenbrook Inn makes no pretense to be a fashionable resort. It especially invites those individuals and families who wish to be free from the exhausting   frivolities of fashion,  to come and enjoy to the full Nature's simple charms, regardless of the city's conventions as to dress and fashion. Rest and recreation, amusement and recuperation are the key-notes. Simplicity of life, abundance of sleep, sufficiency of good food, tastefully served, the chief hours of the day spent in the open air, fishing, boating, swimming, trail-climbing, horseback-riding, driving or automobiling,    these bring health, renewed energy and the joy of life.   The specific pleasures provided at Glenbrook are varied.   355   256     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   It is confessedly the best place for fishing on the Lake. During the season the fishermen from all the resorts at the south end of the Lake bring their patrons over in this direction. The Inn has its own fleet of gasoline launches and row boats, with experienced men to handle them, and it supplies fishing-tackle free, but those who wish to use the rod must bring that with them. As is explained in the chapter on fishing the trout of Lake Tahoe are taken both by rod and   jerk-line  trolling. Near Glenbrook, however, the rod can be used to greater advantage than anywhere else, and catches of from one-half to thirty pounds are of daily occurrence.   While promiscuous fishing is not allowed now in the famous Marlette Lake, eight miles away, the patrons of Glenbrook Inn can always secure permits, without any vexatious inquiries or delays, and there an abundance of gamey trout of various species are caught.   The bathing facilities here are exceptionally good. There is a long stretch of sandy beach, which extends far out into the water, thus ensuring both warmth and safety to children as well as adults.   In mountain and trail climbing Glenbrook has a field all its own. The ride or drive to Marlette Lake is a beautiful one, and the climb to Marlette Peak not arduous. The chief mountain peaks easily reached from Glenbrook are Du-bliss, Edith, and Genoa Peaks, which not only afford the same wonderful and entrancing views of Lake Tahoe that one gains from Freel's, Mt. Tallac, Ellis and Watson's Peaks, but in addition lay before the entranced vision the wonderful Carson Valley, with Mt. Davidson and other historic peaks on the eastern horizon.   The drive along the shore by the famous Cave Rock to Lakeside Park or Tallac is one that can be enjoyed daily, and for those who like driving through and over tree-clad   GLENBROOK INN, ON NEVADA SIDE LAKE TAHOE   SUNSET AT GLENBKOOK, LAKE TAHOE   Copyright,  1910, by Harold A. Parker.   CARNELIAN BAY, LAKE TAHOE   COTTAGE OVERLOOKING CARNELIAN BAY, LAKE TAHOE   GLENBROOK AND MARLETTE LAKE     257   hills, surrounded by majestic mountains, the drive over the Carson road is enchanting.   It is at Glenbrook that the famous Shakspere head is to be seen graphically described by John Vance Cheney, and quoted elsewhere (Chap. XVI).   TO MARLETTE LAKE FROM GLENBROOK   Marlette Lake and Peak are two of the attractive features to visitors at Glenbrook Inn. The trip can be made in a little over two hours, and as on the return it is down hill nearly all the way, the return trip takes a little less.   Leaving Glenbrook on the excellently kept macadamized road over which Hank Monk used to drive stage from Carson City, the eyes of the traveler are constantly observing new and charming features in the mountain landscape. The Lake with its peculiar attractions is left entirely behind, with not another glimpse of it until we stand on the flume at Lake Marlette. Hence it is a complete change of scenery, for now we are looking ahead to tree-clad summits where eagles soar and the sky shines blue.   About two and a half miles out we come to Spooner's, once an active, bustling, roadside hotel, where in the lumbering and mining days teams lined the road four, six and eight deep. Now, nothing but a ramshackle old building remains to tell of its former greatness. Here we made a sharp turn to the left, leaving the main road and taking the special Marlette Lake road. We cross the grade of the abandoned railway     the rails, engines and equipment of which are now operating between Truckee and Tahoe     see in the distance the tunnel through which the trains used to take the lumber, and notice on the hill-sides the lines of the old flumes which used to convey the water to the reservoir on the other side of the tunnel, or bring water and lumber ready to be sent on the further journey down to Carson City.   258     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   My driver was in a reflective mood, and as he pointed these things out to me, made some sage and pertinent remarks about the peculiar features of some industries which required large expenditures to operate, all of which were useless in a comparatively short time. Mainly uphill the road continues through groves of cottonwood, by logged-over mountain slopes and sheep-inhabited meadows until the divide is reached. Here a very rapid down hill speedily brings us to the south edge of Marlette Lake. Skirting the southern end we follow the road to the caretaker's house, tie our horses, and walk down to the dam, and then on the flume or by its side to a point overlooking Lake Tahoe, from which a marvelously expansive view is to be obtained. We return now to Marlette and while drinking a cup of coffee prepared for us by the hospitable caretaker, glean the following facts in regard to the history and uses of Marlette Lake.   Marlette is an artificial lake, fifteen hundred feet above the level of Lake Tahoe, and about three miles from its easterly shore. Its waters are conveyed by tunnel, flume, etc., over the mountains, the Washoe Valley and up the mountain again to Virginia City. Originally the only supply of water available for Virginia City was from a few springs and mining tunnels. This supply soon became insufficient and many tunnels were run into hills both north and south from Virginia for the express purpose of tapping water. These soon failed and it became necessary to look for a permanent supply to the main range of the Sierra Nevada twenty-five or more miles away. Accordingly the Virginia and Gold Hill Water Company called upon Mr. Hermann Schussler, the engineer under whose supervision the Spring Valley Water Works of San Francisco were constructed. After a careful survey of the ground he found water at Hobart Creek, in the mountains on the east side of Lake Tahoe, and in the   GLENBROOK AND MARLETTE LAKE      259   spring of 1872, received orders to go ahead and install a water system. He ordered pipe made to fit every portion of the route. It had to pass across the deep depression of Washoe Valley with water at a perpendicular pressure of 1720 feet, equivalent to 800 pounds to the square inch.   The first operations were so successful that as needs grew the supply flume was extended eight and a half miles to Marlette Lake, thus making the total distance to Virginia City thirty-one and a half miles. This Lake was named after S. H. Marlette, formerly Surveyor General of Nevada, who was associated with W. S. Hobart, of San Francisco, the owner of the land and one of the original projectors of the Water Company. The site was a natural basin, the dam of which had been broken down or eroded centuries ago. A dam was built in 1875, and later raised eleven feet higher so as to afford more storage capacity. The area of the lake is now about 600 acres (before the heightening of the dam it was 300 acres), and its storage capacity is about two billion gallons.   When the supply was enlarged a second pipe was laid alongside the first with an equal capacity, each being able to convey 2,200,000 gallons every twenty-four hours. A third pipe was installed later. The second and third pipes were laid by the late Captain J. B. Overton, who was Superintendent of the Company for over thirty-two years. Captain Overton also extended the flume lines, constructed the tunnel through the mountain ridge, built the Marlette Lake dam and made many other improvements and  extensions.   On leaving Marlette Lake through an opening at the lower portion of the dam the water is conducted five miles in a covered flume and thence through a tunnel four thousand feet long through the summit of the dividing ridge or rim of the Tahoe basin to its easterly side. From this point it is again conducted through covered flumes, together with water   26o     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   from Hobart Creek and other streams, to the intake of the pipes across Washoe Valley. These pipes are three in number, two twelve inch and one ten inch. The difference in elevation between the inlet and discharge from No. I and No. 2 pipes is 465 feet. The difference in elevation between the inlet and discharge of No. 3 pipe is 565 feet. The pipes are laid across Washoe Valley in the form of inverted syphons. At the lowest point in the valley, the perpendicular pressure is 1720 feet on No. I and No. 2 pipes and 1820 feet on No. 3 pipe. The pipe lines go up and down nine canyons in their course across the Valley. Each line is something over seven miles in length. The pressure gauges at Lake View, the point of heaviest pressure, register 820 lbs. on No. 1 and No. 2 pipes when filled, and 910 lbs. on No. 3 pipe when rilled.   When this work was first contemplated many hydraulic engineers condemned the project as impossible, as never before had water been carried so far under such pressure. But the fact that the first pipes laid by Engineer Schussler are still in active use demonstrates the scientific and practical knowledge and skill with which he attacked the problem.   It is an interesting fact to note that, prior to the building of the dam, part of the water was used for   fluming   lumber and wood to Lake View, and also for a short period of time after the dam was constructed. But for the past twenty years this practice has been discontinued, the water being solely for the supply of Virginia City. The total cost of the work was about  3,500,000. The Company is now under the immediate and personal supervision of James M. Leonard. The flumes and pipe-lines have recently been rebuilt and repaired where necessary so that the entire system is in excellent condition and a. high state of efficiency.   GLENBROOK AND MARLETTE LAKE      261   DUBLISS,   EDITH   AND  GENOA   PEAKS   The ride to these three peaks can easily be made in a day, and though they are all in reasonably close proximity, there are differences enough in their respective outlooks to make a visit to each of them enjoyable and profitable. With a good saddle-horse from the Glenbrook stables, a guide, and a lunch tied to the saddle, one may start out confident that a most delightful scenic trip is before him. The first hour's riding is over the rocky and tree-clad slopes, far wilder and more rugged than one would imagine, rudely bordering the Lake southwards. Then turning east, hills and vales, flowery meads and dainty native nurseries of pines, firs and hemlocks enchant the eye. Reaching the summit of any one of the peaks, a wide expanse of Lake is offered, extending to the surrounding mountains north, south and west, but on Genoa Peak an additional charm is found in the close proximity of the Nevada Valley, and mountains to the eastward. The contrast between the richly clad Sierras and the apparently unclothed, volcanic Nevada mountains is remarkable.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXVII   CARNELIAN   BAY  AND  TAHOE   COUNTRY  CLUB   ON making the circuit of the Lake the last stopping-place on the trip starting south, or the first when starting north and east, is Carnelian Bay. This is a new settlement rapidly coming into prominence because of the number of cottages and bungalows erected by their owners on their own lots. From early until late in the seasons of 1913 and 1914 the sounds of the saw and hammer were seldom still. The result is the growth of quite a summer settlement. Easy of access, either by train and steamer from Truckee, or by direct wagon or auto road via Truckee or the new boulevard from the south end of the Lake, Carnelian Bay attracts the real home-seeker. It has been the first section to fully realize what John LeConte has so ably set forth in another chapter on Tahoe as a Summer Residence. With the completion of the state highway around Lake Tahoe and the projected automobile route from Reno and Carson City, Carnelian Bay will be adjacent to the main arteries of travel. The proposed link of the Lincoln Highway around the north shore of the Lake will put Carnelian Bay directly on the great international auto road. The beauties of Lake Tahoe can hardly be magnified to the people of the West. Those who have once viewed its wonders and its magnificence, who have for a season breathed its invigorating and stimulating atmosphere, who have caught the wily trout which abound in its waters, who have sailed, or rowed, or motor-boated over its indigo-blue surface, carry   262   CARNELIAN BAY                        263   in memory pictures in comparison with which any word-picture would be inadequate and incomplete.   Hence the projectors of Carnelian Bay struck a popular note when, out of their 81-acre tract, they put on sale convenient-sized lots. Of these 75 were purchased almost immediately, and by 1914 there were over 45 homes, large and small, already erected. Every lot was sold to a purchaser who expressed his definite intention of speedily erecting a house, cottage or bungalow for his own use. Hence the community is of a selected class into which one may come with confidence and assurance of congenial associations.   While there is no hotel at present there are several cottages and bungalows especially erected for rent to transient guests, and a good store, together with its close proximity to Tahoe City and Tahoe Tavern, render a summer vacation here one of comfort, pleasure and perfect enjoyment.   PROJECTED TAHOE  COUNTRY  CLUB  AT  CARNELIAN   The increasing need exists among those who are familiar with the beauties and advantages of Lake Tahoe as a summer residence resort for accommodations for families or transients where the usual comforts of home may be obtained at a cost not prohibitive to the family of ordinary means. Last year no less than 80,000 persons visited Lake Tahoe. It is safe to say that this number will increase annually, particularly with added accommodations at the Lake and with better facilities for automobile travel. The proximity of Lake Tahoe to the coast cities and the cities of the Sierras and the Middle West makes it at once attractive to the business man who desires to spend his summer vacation where the family is located for the summer months.   The Tahoe Country Club is designed to meet the need. The incorporators have taken over in fee simple a beautiful tract embracing about 1500 feet of the beach at Carnelian   264     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Bay, California, perhaps the most attractive site on Lake Tahoe. It commands a view of the entire length of the Lake, looking toward the south, and embracing a magnificent panoramic view of the mountains beyond. This site contains approximately nine acres, and includes a natural inland harbor, making off from a protected bay. The beach is shallow, of clean sand, sloping down from easy terraces beautified by shade trees and lawns.   The plan of organization of the Tahoe Country Club is cooperative. Its benefits are to be shared by its members, their families, and such of their friends as they may invite to be guests of the club. The properties taken over by the incorporation, including the 1500 feet of beach front, harbor, wharf, and a system of water works already installed, together with the perpetual title to the water rights, is conservatively appraised at  30,000. This is held in fee, free  from incumbrance.   The charter- or organizing-members of the club will be the investors in the bonds issued and secured on the real estate taken over by the incorporation. This bond issue, the redemption of which will be guaranteed by first mortgage on the properties, will be for  20,000. These will be in denominations of  100 each, bearing six per cent, interest after two years from June 1, 1914, and will be redeemable, at the option of the mortgagor, at any regular annual interest period on or after five years from the date of issue. They will be payable in fifteen years.   Each original bond purchaser becomes a charter life member of the club, entitled, without the payment of annual dues or other assessments, to the privileges and benefits offered. These, briefly, aside from the natural advantages of location, scenery, etc., are an assured congenial environment, known associations (not always a possibility in a public summer hotel), the absence of every possible unpleasant influence, op-   PROPOSED FAMILY CLUB HOUSE, CARNELIAN BAY, LAKE TAHOE   LAUNCH TOWING BOATS OUT TO THE FISHING GROUNDS, LAKE TAHOE   AN EARLY MORNING CATCH, TAHOE TROUT, LAKE TAHOE   CARNELIAN BAY                      265   portunities for fishing, boating, tennis, golf and other outdoor sports, and first-class accommodations at a cost far below that charged at regular high-class summer hotels.   The proceeds of the bond issue are to be devoted to the erection of the first unit of the club's buildings, consisting of the club house proper, and probably six four-room cottages adjacent. Thus the value of the real estate securing the bonds will at once be enhanced virtually to the full extent of the investment made by the charter members.   With the initial buildings assured and in process of erection, the membership and patronage of the club will be augmented by extending the privileges of the organization to non-investors, who will be enrolled upon payment of a fixed membership charge. These associate members, like the charter members, will enjoy the privileges offered for themselves and their families and for such of their friends as they may desire to recommend, and for whom limited-period guest-cards are requested.   With a membership so broadly scattered as will be the membership of this club, community control of its affairs would be impracticable, if not impossible. It has been decided, therefore, to vest the supervisory control of the club in a self-perpetuating advisory board, composed of many of the most prominent citizens of Nevada and California.   The plan proposed is a feasible and practicable one, and one that ought to appeal to nature lovers who desire just such opportunities as it will afford on Lake Tahoe. The president of the company and the directing genius who has made Carnelian Bay possible is L. P. Delano, of Reno, Nevada, to whom all requests for further particulars regarding the Tahoe Country Club, or of Carnelian Bay should be addressed.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXVIII   FISHING IN  THE  LAKES  OF  THE TAHOE  REGION   FISHING in Lake Tahoe, and the other lakes of the region is a pleasure and a recreation as       well as an art and a science. There are laymen, tyros, neophytes, proficients and artists.       The real fraternity has passes, catchwords, grips and signals to which outsiders seek to         catch on   in vain.   The chief native trout of Lake Tahoe is locally known as the   cut-throat,  because of a       brilliant dash of red on either side of the throat. The name, however, gives no hint of       the exquisite beauty of the markings of the fish, the skill required and excitement       developed in catching it, and the dainty de-liciousness of its flesh when properly cooked.   Owing to the wonderful adaptability of Lake Tahoe, and the lakes and brooks of the       surrounding region, to fish life, several other well-known varieties have been introduced,       all of which have thrived abundantly and now afford opportunity for the skill of the       fisherman and delight the palate of the connoisseur. These are the Mackinac, rainbow,       eastern brook, and Loch Levin. There is also found a beautiful and dainty silver trout,       along the shore where the cold waters of the various brooks or creeks flow into Lake Tahoe       (and also in some of the smaller lakes), that is much prized. Some fishermen claim that it       is the   prettiest, gamiest, sweetest and choicest  fish of the Lake, and it has been       caught weighing as high as twelve pounds.   Another fish, native to Lake Tahoe, is found in vast numbers by the Indians in the fall.         The ordinary summer visi-   266   FISHING IN THE LAKES                267   tor to Tahoe seldom sees or hears of these, as they rarely bite until the summer season is       over, say in October. This is a white fish, varying in size from half a pound to four       pounds in weight, with finely flavored flesh. It is found in shallow water and near the       mouths of the creeks, and the Indians have a way of   snagging  them in. Building a kind       of half platform and half stone screen over the pools where they abound, the Indians take       a long wire, the end of which they have sharpened and bent to form a rude hook. Then,       without bait, or any attempt at sport, they lower the hook and as rapidly as the fish       appear,   snag   them out, literally by the hundreds. Most of these are salted down for       winter use. This is supposed to be a native, and the traditions of the Indians confirm the       supposition.   The largest native Tahoe trout caught, of which there is any authentic record, was       captured not far from Glenbrook and weighed 35 pounds, and, strange to say, its capturer       was an amateur. This, the boatmen tell me, is generally the case     the amateurs almost       invariably bringing in the largest fish. Although there are rumors of fish having been       caught weighing as high as 45 pounds it is impossible to trace these down to any accurate       and reliable source, hence, until there is positive assurance to the contrary it may be       regarded that this catch is the largest on record.   The common Tahoe method of   trolling  for trout is different from the eastern method. It       is the result of years of experience and is practically as follows: A copper line, 100 to       200 feet long, which sinks of its own weight, on which a large copper spoon is placed       above the hook, which is baited with a minnow and angle-worm, is used. Thrown into the       water the line is gently pulled forward by the angler, then allowed to sink back. He takes       care, however, always to keep it taut. This makes the spoon revolve and attracts the fish.          The moment the angler feels a strike he gives his   268      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   line a quick jerk and proceeds to pull in, landing the fish with the net. The local term       for this method of fishing is   jerk-line.    The copper line used is generally a 6 oz. for ioo feet, and the length is adjusted to the       places in which the fisherman wishes to operate.   Let us, for a short time, watch the would-be angler. Women are often far more eager than       men. The hotels of Tahoe keep their own fishing-boats. The larger ones have a fleet of       twenty or more, and in the season this is found insufficient for the number who wish to       try their hand and prove their luck. Often great rivalry exists not only in securing the       boatmen who have had extra good luck or displayed extraordinary skill, but also between       the guests as to the extent of their various   catches.  When a boatman has taken his         fare   into regions that have proven successful, and does this with frequency, it is       natural that those who wish to run up a large score should try hard to secure him. This       adds to the fun     especially to the onlookers.   The boat is all ready; the angler takes his (or her) seat in the cushioned stern, feet       resting upon a double carpet     this is fishing de luxe. The oarsman pushes off and quietly       rows away from the pier out into deep water, which, at Tahoe varies from 75 feet to the       unknown depths of 1500 feet or more. The color of the water suggests even to the tyro the       depth, and as soon as the   Tahoe blue   is reached the boatman takes his large hand-reel,       unfastens the hook, baits it with minnow and worm and then hands it to the angler, with       instructions to allow it to unreel when thrown out on the port side at the stern.   At the same time he prepares a second hook from a second reel which he throws out at the       starboard side. At the end of each copper line a few yards of fish-cord are attached in       which a loop is adjusted for the fingers.   This holds the   FISHING IN THE LAKES                269   line secure while the backward and forward pulls are being made, and affords a good hold       for the hook-impaling   jerk   when a strike is felt. While the   angler   pulls on, his       line the boatman slowly rows along, and holding his line on the fingers of his   starboard         hand, he secures the proper motion as he rows.   Then, pulling over the ledges or ridges between shallow and deeper, or deeper and deep       water, he exercises all his skill and acquired knowledge and experience to enable his         fare   to make a good catch. As soon as a strike is felt and duly hooked he sees that the       line is drawn in steadily so as not to afford the fish a chance to rid itself of the hook,       and, as soon as it appears, he drops his oar, seizes the net, and lands the catch to the       great delight of his less-experienced fare.   Many are the tales that a privileged listener may hear around the fisherman's       night-haunts, telling of the antics of their many and various fares, when a strike has       been made. Some become so excited that they tangle up their lines, and one boatman assures       me that, on one occasion a lady was so   rattled   that she finally wrapped her line in       such a fashion around both elbows that she sat helpless and he had to come to her rescue       and release her.   On another occasion a pair of   newly-weds   went out angling. When   hubby   caught a       fish, the pair celebrated the catch by enthusiastically kissing, totally regardless of the       surprise or envy that might be excited in the bosom of the poor boatman, and when   wifie         caught a fish the same procedure was repeated.   Of course,  said the boatman, in       telling me the story,   that pair caught more fish than any one I had had for a month,       simply to taunt me with their carryings on.    In the height of the season the guests become the most enthusiastic fishermen of all.          They take a growing pride in   270      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   their increasing scores and the fishing then resolves itself into an earnest, almost       deadly, tournament in which each determines to outscore the others. This is what the       boatmen enjoy    though it often means longer hours and more severe rowing   for it is far       easier to work (so they say) for a   fare   who is really interested than for one who is       halfhearted  and indifferent.   As these rivals' boats pass each other they call out in triumph their rising luck, or       listen gloweringly to the recital of others' good fortune, when they are compelled to       silence because of their own failure.   Sometimes the boatmen find these rivalries rather embarrassing, for the excitement and       nervousness of their   fares   become communicated to them. Then, perhaps, they lose a       promising strike, or, in their hurry, fail to land the fish when it appears. Scolding and       recriminations are not uncommon on such occasions, and thus is the gayety of nations added       to.   What is it that really constitutes  fisherman's luck ? Who can tell? The theories of Tahoe       fishermen are as many as there are men. Some think one thing, some another. One will talk       learnedly of the phases of the moon, another of the effect of warmer or colder weather       upon the   bugs   upon which the fish feed.   Sometimes one will   jerk   half a day and never get a strike; other days the boat will       scarcely have left the wharf before one pulls the fish in almost as fast as hooks can be       baited and thrown out. When fishing is slow an amateur soon becomes tired out. The       monotonous pull on the line soon makes the arm weary, and destroys all enthusiasm. But let       the strikes begin and weariness disappears. Some days the fish will bite for an hour, say       from eleven to twelve, and then quit and not give another strike all day. The very next       day, in the same spot, one cannot get a bite until afternoon.   One of my fishermen friends once related the following:   FISHING IN THE LAKES                271     Again and again I have heard old and experienced fishermen say that no fish can be       caught in a thunder-storm. Yet in July 1913 four boats were towed by a launch out to the       Nevada side, near to Glenbrook. It appeared stormy before the party left, but they refused       to be daunted or discouraged by the doleful prognostications of the   know-it-alls.        Before long the lightning began, the clouds hung heavy, and while they fished they were       treated to alternate doses of thunder, lightning, cloud, sunshine, rain and hail. In less       than an hour every member of the party     and there were several ladies     were soaked and       drenched to the skin, but all were happy. For, contrary to the assertions of the experts,       every angler was having glorious success. Each boat secured its full quota, 40 fish to       each, and the catch averaged 70 pounds to a boat, scarcely a fish being pulled out that       did not weigh over a pound. Talk about luck; these people surely had it.    Once again; I was out one day with Boat No. 14 (each boat has its own number), and the       boatman told me the following story. I know him well and his truthfulness is beyond       question. He had with him two well-known San Francisco gentlemen, whom I will name       respectively, Rosen-baum and Rosenblatt. They were out for the day. For hours they         jerked   without success. At last one turned to the other and said:   Rosie, I've got a       hunch that our luck's going to change. I'm going to count twenty and before I'm through       we'll each have a fish.  Slowly he began to count, one,    two,    three. Just as he counted       fourteen, both men felt a strike, gave the fateful jerk, and pulled in a large fish, and       from that moment their luck changed.   This is not the whole of the story, however. Some days later the same boatman was out on       the Nevada side with two gentlemen, who could not get a bite. Merely to while away the       time the boatman told the foregoing facts.    To his sur-   272     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   prise and somewhat to his disgust at his own indiscretion in telling the story, one of the       gentlemen began to count, and, believe it or not, he assures me that at the fateful       fourteen, he gained a first-class strike, and continued to have success throughout the       afternoon.   As he left the boat he turned to his companion and said:   Well, that fourteen's proved a       lucky number. I'm going right over to the roulette wheel to see what luck it will give me       over there.    My boatman friend added that as he heard nothing of any great winnings at the wheel that       night, and Mr. X. looked rather quiet and sober the next day, he is afraid the luck did       not last. Needless to say that except to me, and then only in my capacity as a writer, the       story has never been told.   Now, while the jerk-line method brings much joy to the heart of the successful and lucky       amateur, the genuine disciple of Izaak Walton scorns this unsportsman-like method. He       comes earlier in the season, April, May, or June, or later, in September, and brings his       rod and line, when the fish keep nearer to the shore in the pot-holes and rocky       formations, and then angles with the fly. It is only at these times, however, that he is       at all likely to have any success, as the Tahoe trout does not generally rise to the fly.   Yet, strange to say, in all the smaller trout-stocked lakes of the region, Fallen Leaf,       Cascade, Heather, Lily, Susie, Lucile, Grass, LeConte, Rock Bound, the Velmas, Angora,       Echo, Tamarack, Lake of the Woods, Rainbow, Pit, Gilmore, Kalmia, Fontinalis, Eagle,       Granite, and as many more, the trout are invariably caught with the fly, though the       species most sought after is not the native Tahoe trout, but the eastern brook. This is       essentially fish for the genuine angler, and many are the tales     true and otherwise           told of the sport the capture of this fish has afforded in the region.   FISHING IN THE LAKES                273   There are several interesting peculiarities about the fish of Lake Tahoe and its region       that it is well to note. In the large lake (Tahoe) the native cutthroat grows to much the       largest size     the 35-lb. one referred to elsewhere being proof of its great growth.   The next in size is the Mackinac which is often caught as large as 10 lb., and now and       again up to 15 lb.   In Fallen Leaf Lake, which was stocked with Mackinac some years ago, the native trout has       become comparatively-scarce, the former seemingly having driven it out, though in Lake       Tahoe there is no such result. In Fallen Leaf not more than one or two in ten will be       cutthroats, while Macki-nacs abound, up to 6 lbs. and 7 lbs. in weight. Occasionally much       larger fish are seen, though they are seldom brought to net. Not long ago a Loch Levin,       weighing 12 lbs., was caught here.   While the catch of fish in the smaller lakes of the region is exceedingly large the fish       themselves are smaller, the opportunities for hiding and fattening and growing older being       comparatively greater in the larger body of water.   During the height of the season when there are a great many boats out it is common to hire       a launch which will tow from four to a dozen boats over towards Emerald Bay on the       California side, or towards Glenbrook on the Nevada side, where the fishing grounds are       known to be of the best. The boatmen especially enjoy these days out     although the         fares  may not always suspect it     as it gives them a change from their ordinary routine       and table fare. They enjoy trout as well as do the visitors, and of course, they are all       expert cooks as well as boatmen. When noon-time comes, if there has been any luck, a       camp-fire is built and the fish are fried, or broiled on the coals, or by experts, made       into an excellent chowder. And never does one enjoy a fish dinner so much as under these       circumstances.   The exercise, the   274     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   fresh air, the motion over the water, the deliciousness and delicate flavor of the fish,       all conspire to tempt the most capricious appetite.   Once in a while a black bass will be caught, though it is not believed that this is a       native fish. It does not seem to thrive in Tahoe though the boatmen tell me they       occasionally see a few, especially off the docks at Tallac and other points at the south       end of the Lake.   Now and again small bull-heads will be seen, and a very small rock-bass. But these never       bite on hook and line, and are seldom found more than two or three inches long.   On the other hand big schools of suckers and chubs are seen. The former naturally are       scorned by all true fishermen as they are regarded as hogs, or scavengers, and are thrown       back whenever caught, or are taken and fed to the gulls or pelicans. The chubs       occasionally are hooked and are from half a pound to a pound and a half in size. As a rule       these are thrown back, though they make good eating to those who do not object to their       excess of bones.   One of the most interesting of sights is to see one of the schools of minnows that fairly       abound in Lake Tahoe. In the clear and pellucid water one can clearly see them swim along.       As they pass a rocky place a trout will dart out and catch his prey. A flutter at once       passes through the whole school. Yet, strange to say, the trout will sometimes swim around       such a body and either stupify them with fear, or hypnotize them into forgetfulness of       their presence, for they will float quietly in the center of the mass, catching the       minnows one by one as they need them without exciting the least fear or attention. The       minnows generally remain in fairly shallow water, and keep so closely together that a line       of demarcation is made between where they are and outside, as if it had been cut with a       knife along a straight edge, and   FISHING IN THE LAKES                275   in some mysterious way the fish dare not cross it, though it constantly moves along with       their movements.   It will be obvious that necessarily there is much market-fishing in Lake Tahoe and its       surrounding lakes. Indeed there are large numbers of fishermen     Indians and whites     who       supply the various hotels both of the Lake region and in San Francisco, Oakland,       Sacramento and adjacent cities, and even as far as Denver and Salt Lake City, eastwards,       and Los Angeles to the south. These fishermen are very persistent in their work, keeping       at it from early morning until late at night, though their catches are supposed to be       officially regulated.   The amount of fish caught and shipped by these market-fishermen is remarkable. In 1911 the       report shows that over 22,000 pounds were sent out by express, over half of which were       sent from Tallac alone. And this does not take any account of the amount caught and eaten       by private residents around the Lake, by the visitors or by the hotels.   The fish that are to be shipped are not, as one might naturally suppose, packed in ice.       Experience has demonstrated a better way which is now universally followed. At Tallac the       hotel has a large place devoted to this process, which is practically as follows: Each       boatman has a fish-box, numbered to correspond with his boat. These are kept in the water       during the season, and if the catch of his  fare  for one day is not sufficient for a       shipment it is placed in the box. When a sufficient number is on hand, they are taken out       by the boatman, carefully cleaned and hung up to dry in fly-proof, open-air cages. When       perfectly dry inside and out they are packed in sweet-smelling Tallac Meadow hay, and       shipped by express.   Many visitors cannot understand why there are no fish in some of the lakes that, to their       eyes, seem just as well   276     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   adapted for fish as others that possess an abundance. Even old timers do not all know the       reason. If a lake is shallow, when the deep snow falls it soon sinks below the surface in       a heavy mushy mass that presses down upon the fish and prevents their breathing. Then, if       a severe frost follows and the mass freezes the ice squeezes the fish to the bottom. Over       three years ago Watson took fish to Bessie Lake, putting in as many as 6000 fry of Lake       Tahoe and other species. The next year, and the following years they were all right,       having grown to eight or nine inches in length. Then came a severe winter and in the       spring there was not a living fish left. The bottom was strewn with them, many of them       with broken backs.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXIX   HUNTING  AT  LAKE  TAHOE   IN the chapter on the Birds and Animals of the Tahoe Region I have written of the game to be found. There are few places left in the Sierras where such good deer-and bear-hunting can be found as near Tahoe. During the dense snow-falls the deer descend the western slopes, approaching nearer and nearer to the settlements of the upper foothills, and there they do fairly well until the snow begins to recede in the spring. They keep as near to the snow line as possible, and are then as tame and gentle almost as sheep. When the season opens, however, they soon flee to certain secret recesses and hidden lairs known to none but the old and experienced guides of the region. There are so many of these wooded retreats, however, and the Tahoe area is so vast, that it is seldom an expert goes out for deer (or bear) that he fails. Hence the sportsman is always assured of   something worth while.    As for bear I have told elsewhere of recent hunts on Mt. Freel from Tallac, and the two bears killed there in 1913, and of Carl Flugge's experiences. With Tallac hunters, Flugge, Bob Watson or any other experienced man, one can scarcely fail to have exciting and successful times.   277

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXX   THE   FLOWERS  OF  THE  TAHOE  REGION   IT would be impossible in the space of a brief chapter to present even a list of all the       flowers found and recorded in the Tahoe Region. Suffice it to say that 1300 different       species already have been listed. This chapter will merely call attention to the most       prominent, or, on the other hand, the rarer and special flowering plants that the visitor       should eagerly search for.   As fast as the snow retires from the sun-kissed slopes the flowers begin to come out.       Indeed in April, were one at Tahoe, he could make a daily pilgrimage to the receding       snow-line and there enjoy new revelations of dainty beauty each morning. For the flowers,       as the snow-coating becomes thinner, respond to the   call of the sun,  and thrust up       their spears out of the softened and moistened earth, so that when the last touch of snow       is gone they are often already in bud ready to burst forth into flower at the first kiss       of sunshine.   In May they come trooping along in all their pristine glory, God's thoughts cast upon the       mold of earth, so that even the men and women of downcast eyes and souls may know the       ever-fresh, ever-present love of God.   Most interesting of all is the snow-plant (sarcodes san-guinea Torrey). The name is       unfortunate. The plant doesn't look like snow, nor does it grow on or in the snow. It       simply follows the snow line, as so many of the Sierran plants do, and as the snow melts       and leaves the valley, one   278   FLOWERS OF THE TAHOE REGION     279   must climb to find it. It is of a rich red color, which glows in the sunlight like a       living thing. It has no leaves but is supplied with over-lapping scale-like bracts of a       warm flesh-tint. At the lower part of the flower these are rigid and closely adherent to       the stem, but higher up they become looser and curl gracefully about among the vivid red       bells. In the spring of 1914 they were wonderfully plentiful at the Tavern and all around       the Lake. I literally saw hundreds of them.   Next in interest comes the heather, both red and white. In Desolation Valley, as well as       around most of the Sierran lakes of the Tahoe Region, beds of heather are found that have       won enthusiastic Scotchmen to declare that Tahoe heather beats that of Scotland. The red       heather is the more abundant, and its rich deep green leaves and crown of glowing red       makes it to be desired, but the white heather is a flower fit for the delicate corsage       bouquet of a queen, or the lapel of the noblest of men. Dainty and exquisite, perfect in       shape and color its tiny white bell is par-excellence the emblem of passionate purity.   Blue gentians (Gentina calycosa, Griseb) abound, their deep blue blossoms rivaling the       pure blue of our Sierran skies. These often come late in the season and cheer the hearts       of those who come upon them with   a glad sweet surprise.     There are also white       gentians found aplenty.   The water lilies of the Tahoe Region are strikingly beautiful. In many of the Sierran       lakes conditions seem to exist which make them flourish and they are found in plentiful       quantities.   Wild marigolds abound in large patches, even on the mountain heights, where there is       plenty of moisture and sunshine, and a species of marguerite, or mountain daisy, is not       uncommon. The Indian paint-brush is found everywhere and is in full bloom in deepest red       in September.   280      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Wild sunflowers also abound except where the sheep have been. Then not a sign of once vast       patches can be found. They are eaten clear to the ground.   The mullein attains especial dignity in this mountain region. Stately and proud it rises       above the lesser though more beautiful flowers of the wild. It generally dies down in       September, though an occasional flowering stalk may be seen as late as October.   Another very common but ever-welcome plant, for its pungent and pleasing odor, is the       pennyroyal. It abounds throughout the whole region and its hardiness keeps it flowering       until late in the fall.   Beautiful and delicate at all times wherever seen, the wild snowdrop is especially welcome       in the Tahoe Region, where, amid soaring pines and firs, it timidly though faithfully       blooms and cheers the eye with its rare purity.   Now and again one will find the beautiful California fuschia (zauschneria Californica,       Presl.) its delicate beauty delighting the eye and suggesting some of the rare orchids of       a pale yellow tint.   The Sierra primrose (Primula Suffrutescens) is often found near to the snow-line. Its       tufts of evergreen leaves seem to revel in the cold water of the melting snow and the       exquisite rose-tints of the flowers are enhanced by the pure white of what snow is left to       help bring them into being.   It is natural that, in a region so abounding in water, ferns of many kinds should also       abound. The common brake flourishes on the eastern slopes, but I have never found the       maiden hair. On the western slopes it is abundant, but rarely if ever found on the       easterly exposures.   Most striking and attractive among the shrubs are the mountain ash, the mountain mahogany       (cereocarpus parvi-folius, Nutt.) the California laurel (umbellularia Californica, Nutt.)       and the California holly, or toy on.   The rich   FLOWERS OF THE TAHOE REGION     281   berries, the green leaves, the exquisite and dainty flowers, the delicious and stimulating       odors all combine to make these most welcome in every Sierran landscape, no matter at what       season they appear.   While in the foregoing notes on the flowers of the Tahoe region I have hastily gone over       the ground, one particular mountain to the north of Tahoe has been so thoroughly and       scientifically studied that it seems appropriate to call more particular attention to it       in order that botanists may realize how rich the region is in rare treasures. For what       follows I am indebted to the various writings of Professor P. Bev-eridge Kennedy, long       time professor at the University of Nevada, but recently elected to the faculty of the       University of California.   One could almost write a   Botany   of Mt. Rose alone, so interesting are the floral       specimens found there. This mountain stands unique in the Lake Tahoe region in that it is       an intermediate between the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada and those of the interior       of the Great Basin. Its flora are undoubtedly influenced by the dry atmospheric conditions       that exist on the eastern side. A mere suggestion only can be given here of the full       enjoyment afforded by a careful study of what it offers.   At from 10,000 feet up the following new species have been found. Eriogonum rhodanthum, a       perennial which forms dense mats on hard rocky ground. The caudex is made up of many       strands twisted together like rope, its numerous branches terminated by clusters of very       small, new and old leaves, with flower clusters. Another similar species is the E.       rosensis.   An interesting rock-cress is found in the Arabis Depau-perata, which here shows the       results of its fierce struggles for existence.    It bears minute purple flowers.   Flowering in the middle of August, but past flowering at   282      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   the end of September the Gilia montana is found, with its numerous white and pink leaves.   Nearby is the Phlox dejecta in large quantities, resembling a desert moss, and covering       the rocks with its tinted carpet.   An Indian paint-brush with a flower in an oblong cream-colored spike, with purple       blotches, was named Castilleia inconspicua, possibly because it is so much less       conspicuous and alluring to the eye than its well-known and striking brother of the       California fields, C. parviflora. This species has been of great interest to botanists, as       when first observed it was placed in the genus Orthocarpus. Professor Kennedy thinks it is       undoubtedly a connecting link between the two genera. It has been found only on Mount       Rose, where it is common at between 9000 and 10,000 feet elevation. It reaches, however,       to the summit, though it is more sparingly found there.   Professor Kennedy also describes Hulsea Caespitosa, or Alpine dandelion, a densely       pubescent plant, emitting a disagreeable odor, whose large yellow flowers surprise one       when seen glowing apparently out of the masses of loose volcanic rock. It is soon found,       however, that they have roots deep down in good soil beneath. Another new species,       Chryso-thamnus Monocephala, or Alpine rabbit-brush, is a very low, shrubby plant, with       insignificant pale yellow flowers.   A beautiful little plant, well adapted to rockeries and suited for cultivation, is       Polemonium Montrosense. Under good conditions it grows excellently. It was found on the       summit of Mt. Rose, and at lower elevations.   Clusters of the Alpine Monkey-flower (Mimulus Im-plexus, Greene), are also found on Mt.       Rose, as well as on other Tahoe mountain summits. The rich yellow flowers bloom profusely,       though their bed is often a moraine of wet rocks over which a turbulent cold stream has       recently subsided.   FLOWERS OF THE TAHOE REGION     283   Slightly below the summit the little elephant's-head have been found  Elephantella       attolens (Gray) Heller). Ryd-berg in his Flora of Montana showed that these were not       properly the true pendiculariSj as they had hitherto been regarded, hence the new name.       The corolla strikingly resembles the head of an elephant, the beak of the galea forming       the trunk, the lateral lobes of the lips the ears, and the stigma the finger-like       appendage of the trunk.   In August, growing below the perpetual snow banks at about 10,000 feet elevation that       supply an abundance of moisture, one will often find clumps of Rhodiola Integrifolia,       which attract the eye with their deep reddish-purple flowers and fruits.    The leaves       also have a purple tinge.   Nearby clambering over the granite bowlders the Alpine heath, Cassiope Mertensianae, with       its multitude of rose-tinted flower bells, sometimes is found, though not in the profusion       it displays in Desolation Valley.   Another very interesting plant is the Alpine currant (Ribes Inebrians, Lindl.) which       between the years 1832 and 1907 has received no less than eight different names accorded       by European and American botanists. It is a remarkable shrub, in that it occurs higher on       the mountain than any other form of vegetation except lichens. The roots penetrate deeply       into the crevices of the lava rocks, enabling it to withstand the fierce winds. The       flowers, which appear in August, are white, shading to pink, and the red berries, which       are not especially palatable on account of their insipid taste and numerous seeds, are       abundant in September. Another new Mt. Rose ribes has been named Churchii in honor of       Professor J. E. Church, Jr., whose original work at the Mt. Rose Observatory is described       in the chapter devoted to that purpose.   Growing at elevations of from 6000 to 10,000 feet, displaying a profusion of white flowers       sometimes delicately   284     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   tinged with light purple is the Phlox Douglasii, Hook. It is low but with loose,       much-branched prostrate stems and remarkably stout, almost woody roots.   A new Alpine willow (Salix Caespitosa) has also been discovered.    Professor Kennedy thus       writes of it:   The melting snow, as it comes through and over the rocks in the nature of a spring, brings       with it particles of sand and vegetation, which form a very shallow layer of soil on a       flat area to one side of the main branch of the stream. On this the willow branches adhere       like ivy, rooting at every joint and interlaced so as to form a dense mat. From these,       erect leafy shoots, one or two inches high, appear, with the many flowered catkins       extending above the foliage. The pistillate plants occupy separate but adjacent areas to       the staminate ones.   PROFESSOR FERGUSSON AT THE FERGUSSON METEOROGRAPH AT MT.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXXI   THE  CHAPARRAL  OF THE TAHOE REGION   THE word chaparral is a Spanish word, transferred bodily into our language, without, however, retaining its strict and original significance.    In Spanish it means a plantation of evergreen oaks, or, thick bramble-bushes entangled with thorny shrubs in clumps.    Hence, in the west, it has come to mean, any low or scrub brush that thickly covers a hill or mountain-side.    As there is a varied chaparral in the Tahoe region, it is well for the visitor to know of what it is mainly composed.   Experience has demonstrated that where the larger lumber is cut off close on the Sierran slopes of the Tahoe region the low bushy chaparral at once takes full possession. It seems to prevent the tree seeds from growing and thus is an effectual preventive to reforestation. This, however, is generally not so apparent east of the main range as it is on the western slopes. One of its chief elements is the man-zanita (Arctostaphylos patula) easily distinguishable by the red wood of its stem and larger branches, glossy leaves, waxen blossoms (when in flower) and green or red berries in the early autumn.   The snow-bush abounds. It is a low sage-green bush, very thorny, hence is locally called   bide-a-wee   from the name given by the English soldiers to a very thorny bush they had to encounter during the Boer War. In the late days of spring and even as late as July it is covered with a white blossom that makes it glorious and attractive.   285   286      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Then there is the thimble-berry with its big, light yellow, sprawling leaves, and its attractively red, thimble-shaped, but rather tasteless berries. The Indians, however, are very fond of them, and so are some of the birds and animals, likewise of the service berries, which look much like the blueberry, though their flavor is not so choice.   Here and there patches of the wild gooseberry add to the tangle of the chaparral. The gooseberries when ripe are very red, as are the currants, but they are armored with a tough skin completely covered with sharp, hairy thorns. In Southern California all the fruit of the wild ribes have the thorns, but they do not compare in penetrating power and strength with those of the Tahoe gooseberries.   One of the most charming features of the chaparral is the mountain ash, especially when the berries are ripe and red. The Scotch name rowan seems peculiarly appropriate. Even while the berries are yellow they are attractive to the eye, and alluring to the birds, but when they become red they give a splendid dash of rich color that sets off the whole mountain side.   The mountain mahogany is not uncommon  Cereocarpus parvifolius, Nutt.) and though its green flowers are inconspicuous, its long, solitary plumes at fruiting time attract the eye.   While the California laurel (Umbellularia Californica, Nutt.) often grows to great height, it is found in chaparral clumps on the mountain sides. It is commonly known as the bay tree, on account of the bay-like shape and odor of its leaves when crushed. It gives a spicy fragrance to the air and is always welcome to those who know it.   In many places throughout the mountains of the Tahoe region there are clumps or groves of wild cherry (Prunus Demissa, Walpers), the cherries generally ripening in September.    But if one expects the ripe red wild cherries to have   CHAPARRAL OF THE TAHOE REGION      287   any of the delicious richness and sweetness of the ripe Queen Anne or other good variety he is doomed to sad disappointment. For they are sour and bitter     bitter as quinine,    and that is perhaps the reason their juice has been extracted and made into medicine supposed to have extraordinary tonic and healing virtue.   The elder is often found  Sambucus Glauca, Nutt.), sometimes quite tall and at other times broken down by the snow, but bravely covering its bent and gnarled trunks and branches with dense foliage and cream-white blossom-clusters. The berries are always attractive to the eye in their purple tint, with the creamy blush on them, and happy is that traveler who has an expert make for him an elderberry pie, or distill the rich cordial the berries make.   Another feature of the chaparral often occupies the field entirely to itself, viz., the chamisal or greasewood  Adenos-toma fasciculatum, Hook, and Arn.). Its small clustered and needle-like leaves, richly covered with large, feathery panicles of tiny blossoms, give it an appearance not unlike Scotch heather, and make a mountainside dainty and beautiful.   The California buckeye  Aesculus Californicaj Nutt.) is also found, especially upon stream banks or on the moist slopes of the canyons. Its light gray limbs, broad leaves, and long, white flower-spikes make it an attractive shrub or tree (for it often reaches forty feet in height), and when the leaves drop, as they do early, the skeleton presents a beautiful and delicate network against the deep azure of the sky.   Another feature of the chaparral is the scrub oak. In 1913 the bushes were almost free from acorns. They generally appear only every other year, and when they do bear the crop is a wonderfully numerous one.   A vast amount of wild lilac  Ceanothus Velutinus) is found on all the slopes.    It generally blooms in June and   288     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   then the hillsides are one fragrant and glowing mass of vivid white tinged with the creamy hue that adds so much charm to the flowers.   The year 1913, however, was a peculiar year, throughout, for plant life. In the middle of September in Page's Meadows a large patch of ceanothus was in full bloom, either revealing a remarkably late flowering, or a second effort at beautification.   Another ceanothus, commonly called mountain birch, is often found. When in abundance and in full flower it makes a mountain side appear as if covered with drifted snow.   Willows abound in the canyons and on the mountains of the Tahoe region, and they are an invariable sign of the near presence of water.   There is scarcely a canyon where alders, cottonwoods and quaking aspens may not be found. In 1913 either the lack of water, some adverse climatic condition, or some fungus blight caused the aspen leaves to blotch and fall from the trees as early as the beginning of September. As a rule they remain until late in October, changing to autumnal tints of every richness and hue and reminding one of the glorious hues of the eastern maples when touched by the first frosts of winter.   To one used to exploring dry and desert regions, such as the Colorado and Mohave Deserts of Southern California, the Grand Canyon region, the Navajo Reservation, etc., in Arizona and New Mexico, the constant presence of water in the Tahoe region is a perpetual delight. Daily in my trips here I have wondered at the absence of my canteen and sometimes in moments of forgetfulness I would reach for it, and be almost paralyzed with horror not to find it in its accustomed place. But the never-ending joy of feeling that one could start out for a day's trip, or a camping-out expedi-   CHAPARRAL OF THE TAHOE REGION      289   tion of a week or a month and never give the subject of water a moment's thought, can only be appreciated by those who are direfully familiar with the dependence placed upon the canteen in less favored regions.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXXII   HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE TREES OF THE TAHOE REGION   BY   trees   in this chapter I mean only the evergreen trees     the  pines,   firs,  spruces,  hemlocks,   cedars, junipers and tamaracks.    Many visitors like to know at least enough when they are looking at a tree, to tell which of the above species it belongs to.    All I aim to do here is to seek to make clear the distinguishing features of the various trees, and to give some of the more readily discernible signs of the different varieties of the same species found in the region.   It must not be forgotten that tree growth is largely dependent upon soil conditions. The soil of the Tahoe region is chiefly glacial detritus.   On the slopes and summits of the ridges it is sandy, gravelly, and liberally strewn with masses of drift bowlders. The flats largely formed of silting while they still constituted beds of lakes, have a deep soil of fine sand and mold resting on coarse gravel and bowlder drift. Ridges composed of brecciated lavas, which crumble easily under the influence of atmospheric agencies, are covered with soil two or three feet, or even more, in depth, where gentle slopes or broad saddles have favored deposition and prevented washing. The granite areas of the main range and elsewhere have a very thin soil. The flats at the entrance of small streams into Lake Tahoe are covered with deep soil, owing to deposition of vegetable matter brought from the slopes adjacent to their channels. As a whole, the soil of the region is of sufficient fertility to support a heavy forest growth,  its depth depends wholly on local circumstances   290   HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE TREES      291   favoring washing and removal of the soil elements as fast as formed, or holding them in place and compelling accumulations.1   Coniferous species of trees constitute fully ninety-five per cent, of the arborescent growth in the region. The remaining five per cent, consists mostly of different species of oak, ash, maple, mountain-mahogany, aspen, cottonwood, California buckeye, western red-bud, arborescent willows, alders, etc   Of the conifers the species are as follows: yellow pine, pinus ponderosa; Jeffrey pine, pinus jeffreyi; sugar pine, pinus lambertiana; lodge-pole pine, pinus murrayana; white pine, pinus monticola; digger pine, pinus sabiniana; white-bark pine, pinus albicaulis; red fir, pseudotsuga taxifolia; white fir, abies concolor; Shasta fir, abies magnificat; patton hemlock or alpine spruce, tsuga pattoniana; incense cedar, libocedrus decurrens; western juniper, juniperus occidentalis; yew, taxus brevifolia.   The range and chief characteristic of these trees, generally speaking, are as follows:   Digger Pine. This is seldom found in the Tahoe region, except in the lower reaches of the canyons on the west side of the range. It is sometimes known as the Nut Pine, for it bears a nut of which the natives are very fond. It has two cone forms, one in which the spurs point straight down, the other in which they are more or less curved at the tip. They grow to a height of forty to fifty and occasionally ninety feet high; with open crown and thin gray foliage.   Western Juniper. This is a typical tree of the arid regions east of the Sierra, yet it is to be found scattered throughout the Tahoe country, generally at an elevation between five thousand and eight thousand feet.    It ranges in   1 John B. Leiberg, in Forest Conditions in the Northern Sierra Nevada.   292      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   height from ten to twenty-five or even sixty-five feet. Its dull red bark, which shreds or flakes easily, its berries, which begin a green color, shade through to gray, and when ripe are a rich purple, make it readily discernible. It is a characteristic feature of the scenery at timber line in many Tahoe landscapes.   With the crowns beaten by storms into irregular shapes, often dead on one side but flourishing on the other, the tops usually dismantled and the trunks excessively thickened at base, such figures, whether erect, half overthrown or wholly crouching, are the most picturesque of mountain trees and are frequently of very great age.    Jepson.   Yen/. This is not often found and then only in the west canyons above the main range. It is a small and insignificant tree, rarely exceeding forty feet in height. It has a thin red-brown smooth bark which becomes shreddy as it flakes off in thin and rather small pieces. The seeds are borne on the under side of the sprays and when mature set in a fleshy scarlet cup, the whole looking like a brilliantly colored berry five or six inches long. They ripen in July ot August.   Incense Cedar. This is commonly found all over the region at elevations below 7500 feet, though its chief habitat is at elevations of 3500 to 6000 feet. It grows to a height of fifty to one hundred and fifty feet, with a strongly conical trunk, very thick at the base, and gradually diminishing in size upward. The bark is thick, red-brown, loose and fibrous, and when the tree is old, broken into prominent heavy longitudinal furrows. The cones are red-brown, oblong-ovate when closed, three-fourths to an inch long.   Shasta Fir. This is found on the summits, slopes and shores of Lake Tahoe, and to levels 6200 feet in elevation on the slopes and summits directly connected with the main range.    It is found along the Mount Pluto  ridge.    It is   HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE TREES      293   essentially a tree of the mountains, where the annual precipitation ranges from fifty inches upward. In the Tahoe region it is locally known as the red fir. Sometimes it is called the red bark fir and golden fir. It grows from sixty to even one hundred and seventy-five feet high with trunk one to five feet in diameter and a narrowly cone-shaped crown composed of numerous horizontal strata of fan-shaped sprays. The bark on young trees is whitish or silvery, on old trunks dark red, very deeply and roughly fissured. The cones when young are of a beautiful dull purple, when mature becoming brown.   White Pine. This is found on northern slopes as low down as 6500 feet, though it generally ranges above 7000 feet, and is quite common. It sometimes is called the silver pine, and generally in the Tahoe region, the mountain pine. It grows to a height of from fifty to one hundred and seventy-five feet, the branches slender and spreading or somewhat drooping, and mostly confined to the upper portion of the shaft. The trunk is from one to six feet in diameter and clothed with a very smooth though slightly checked whitish or reddish bark. The needles are five (rarely four) in a place, very slender, one to three and three-fourths inches long, sheathed at the base by thinnish narrow deciduous scales, some of which are one inch long. The cones come in clusters of one to seven, from six to eight or rarely ten inches long, very slender when closed and usually curved towards the tip, black-purple or green when young, buff-brown when ripe. It is best recognized by its light-gray smooth bark, broken into squarish plates, its pale-blue-green foliage composed of short needles, and its pendulous cones so slender as to give rise to the name   Finger-Cone Pine.    Sugar Pine. This is found on the lower terraces of Tahoe, fringing the region with a sparse and scattering growth, but it is not found on the higher slopes of the Sierra.    On   294      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   the western side its range is nearly identical with that of the red fir. It grows from eighty to one hundred and fifty feet high, the young and adult trees symmetrical, but the aged trees commonly with broken summits or characteristically flat-topped with one or two long arm-like branches exceeding shorter ones. The trunk is from two to eight feet in diameter, and the bark brown or reddish, closely fissured into rough ridges. The needles are slender, five in a bundle, two to three and a half inches long. The cones are pendulous, borne on stalks at the end of the branches, mostly in the very summit of the tree, very long-oblong, thirteen to eighteen inches long, four to six inches in diameter when opened.   This pine gains its name from its sugary exudation, sought by the native tribes, which forms hard white crystallized nodules on the upper side of fire or ax wounds in the wood. This flow contains resin, is manna-like, has cathartic properties, and is as sweet as cane-sugar. The seeds are edible. Although very small they are more valued by the native tribes than the large seeds of the Digger Pine on account of their better flavor. In former days, when it came October, the Indians went to the high mountains about their valleys to gather the cones. They camped on the ridges where the sugar pines grow and celebrated' their sylvan journey by tree-climbing contests among the men. In these latter days, being possessed of the white man's ax, they find it more convenient to cut the tree down. It is undoubtedly the most remarkable of all pines, viewed either from the standpoint of its economic value or sylvan interest. It is the largest of pine trees, considered whether as to weight or girth, and more than any other tree gives beauty and distinction to the Sierran forest.    Jepson.   The long cones found in abundance about Tahoe Tavern are those of the sugar pine.   Yellow Pine and Jeffrey Pine.   These are practically one   HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE TREES     295   and the same, though the latter is generally regarded as a variety and the former the type.    Mr. Leiberg says:   The two forms differ chiefly in the size of the cones, in the tint and odor of the foliage, and in the color and thickness of the bark, differences which are insufficient to constitute specific characters. The most conspicuous of the above differences is that in the size of the cones, which may seemingly hold good if only a few hundred trees are examined. But when one comes to deal with thousands of individuals the distinction vanishes. It is common to find trees of the Jeffrey type as to foliage and bark that bear the big cones, and the characteristic smaller cones of the typical yellow pine, both at the same time and on the same individual, while old cones strewn about on the ground indicate that in some seasons trees of the Jeffrey type produce only small-sized cones. The odor and the color of leaves and bark are more or less dependent on soil conditions and the inherent vitality of the individual tree, and the same characters are found in specimens belonging to the yellow and Jeffrey pine. It is noticeable that the big-cone variety preferably grows at considerable elevation and on rocky sterile ground, while the typical form of the yellow pine prevails throughout the lower regions and on tracts with a more generous soil.   The yellow pine has a wider range than any other of the Tahoe conifers, though on the high, rocky areas, south and west of Rubicon Springs it is lacking. It crosses from the western slopes to the eastern sides of the Sierras and down into the Tahoe basin over the heads of Miller and McKin-ney Creeks, in both places as a thin line, or rather as scattering trees mixed with Shasta fir and white pine.   It grows from sixty to two hundred and twenty-five feet high with trunk two to nine feet in diameter. The limbs in mature trees are horizontal or even drooping. The bark of typical trees is tawny yellow or yellow-brown, divided by fissures into large smoothish or scaly-surfaced plates which are often one to four feet long and one-half to one and a quarter   296      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   feet wide.    The needles are in threes, five to ten inches long; the cones reddish brown.   It must be noted, too, that   the bark is exceedingly variable, black-barked or brown-barked trees, roughly or narrowly fissured, are very common and in their extreme forms very different in trunk appearance from the typical or most-abundant ' turtle-back' form with broad, yellow or light brown plates.     Jepson.   Lodge Pole Pine. The range of this tree is almost identical with that of the Shasta fir, though here and there it is found at as low an altitude as 4500 feet. It loves the margins of creeks, glades and lakes situated at altitudes of 6000 feet and upward, where it usually forms a fringe of nearly pure growth in the wet and swampy portions of the ground. In the Tahoe region it is invariably called a tamarack or tamarack pine. It is a symmetrical tree commonly reaching as high as fifty to eighty feet, but occasionally one hundred and twenty-five feet. When stunted, however, it is only a few feet. The bark is remarkably thin, rarely more than one quarter inch thick, light gray in color, very smooth but flaking into small thin scales. There are only two needles to a bunch, in a sheath, one and a half to two and three quarters inches long. The cones are chestnut brown, one to one and three quarters inches long.   It is when sleeping under the lodge pole pines that you begin to appreciate their perfect charm and beauty. You unroll your blankets at the foot of a stately tree at night, unconscious and careless as to what tree it is. During the night, when the moon is at the full, you awaken and look up into a glory of shimmering light. The fine tapering shape, the delicate fairy-like beauty, instantly appeal to the sensitive soul and he feels he is in a veritable temple of beauty.   They are very sensitive trees.    In many places a mere   HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE TREES      297   grass fire, quick and very fierce for a short time, has destroyed quite a number.   White Fir. This follows closely the range of the incense cedar, though in some places it is found as high as 8700 feet. It is one of the most perfect trees in the Sierras. Ranging from sixty to one hundred and fifty and even two hundred feet high, with a narrow crown composed of flat sprays and a trunk naked for one-third to one-half its height and from one to six feet in diameter, with a smooth bark, silvery or whitish in young trees, becoming thick and heavily fissured into rounded ridges on old trunks, and gray or drab-brown in color, it is readily distinguishable, with its companion, the red fir, by the regularity of construction of trunk, branch and branchlet. As Smeaton Chase expresses it,   The fine smooth arms, set in regular formation, divide and redivide again and again ad infinitum, weaving at last into a maze of exquisitely symmetrical twigs and branchlets.    Red Fir. The range of the red fir is irregular. It occurs on the Rubicon River and some of the headwaters of the west-flowing streams, reaching a general height of 6000 feet, though it is occasionally found as high as 7000 feet. In some parts of California this is known as Douglas Spruce, and Jepson, in his Silva of California definitely states:   The name   fir   as applied to the species is so well established among woodsmen that for the sake of intelligibility the combination Douglas Fir, which prevents confusion with the true firs and has been adopted by the Pacific Coast Lumberman's Association, is here accepted, notwithstanding that the name used by botanists,   Douglas Spruce   is actually more fitting on account of the greater number of spruce-like characteristics. It is neither true spruce, fir, nor hemlock, but a marked type of a distinct genus, namely, pseudotsuga.   It must not be confounded with the red silver fir  Abies Magnifica) so eloquently described as the chief delight of the   298     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Yosemite region by Smeaton Chase. It grows from seventy to two hundred and fifty or possibly three hundred and fifty feet high, and is the most important lumber tree of the country, considering the quality of its timber, the size and length of its logs, and the great amount of heavy wood and freedom from knots, shakes or defects. On young trees the bark is smooth, gray or mottled, sometimes alder-like; on old trunks one to six and a half inches thick, soft or putty-like, dark brown, fissured into broad heavy furrows. The young rapid growth in the open woods produces   red fir,  the older slower growth in denser woods is   yellow fir.  Every tree to a greater or lesser extent exhibits successively these two phases, which are dependent upon situation and exposure.   The chief difference between the white and red fir is in the spiculae or leaves. Those of the red fir are shorter, stubbier and stiffer than those of the white. The bark, however, is pretty nearly alike in young trees and shows a marked difference when they get to be forty to fifty years old.   The Alpine Spruce (Hesperopeuce Pattoniana Lemmon) is found only in the highest elevations. Common in Alaska it is limited in the Tahoe region to the upper points of forests that creep up along glacier beds and volcanic ravines, close to perpetual ice. It disappears at 10,000 feet altitude on Mt. Whitney and is found nowhere south of this point. On Tallac, Mt. Rose and all the higher peaks of the Tahoe region it is common, giving constant delight with its slender shaft, eighty to a hundred feet high, and with a diameter at its base of from six to twelve feet. It is only in the lower portions of the belt where it occurs. Higher it is reduced to low conical masses of foliage or prostrate creeping shrubs.   By many it is regarded as a hemlock, but it is not strictly so. It was first discovered in 1852 by John Jeffrey, who followed David Douglas in his explorations of the forests of the American Northwest.   HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE TREES      299   In favorable situations, the lower limbs are retained and become long, out-reaching, and spreading over the mountain slope for many feet; the upper limbs are irregularly disposed, not whorled; they strike downward from the start (so that it is almost impossible to climb one of the trees for want of foothold), then curving outward to the outline of the tree, they are terminated by short, hairy branchlets that decline gracefully, and are decorated with pendant cones which are glaucous purple until maturity, then leather brown, with reflexed scales.   The main stem sends out strong ascending shoots, the leading one terminating so slenderly as to bend from side to side with its many purple pendants before the wind, and shimmering in  the sunlight with rare  beauty.    Lemmon.   On the slopes of Mt. Rose near timber line, which ranges from 9700 to 10,000 feet according to exposures, while still a tree of considerable size, it loses its symmetrical appearance. Professor Kennedy says:   Buffeted by the fierce winter winds and snows, the branches on the west side of the tree are either entirely wanting or very short and gnarled, and the bark is commonly denuded. Unlike its associate, Pinus Albicaulis, which is abundant as a prostrate shrub far above timber line, the spruce is rarely encountered above timber line at this place, but here and there a hardy individual may be found lurking among the pines. The greatest elevation at which it was noticed is  10,500 feet.   To me this is one of the most beautiful of Sierran trees. Its delicate silvery hue, and the rarely exquisite shading from the old growth to the new, its gracefulness, the quaint and fascinating tilt of its tip which waveringly bends over in obedience to whichever breeze is blowing makes it the most alluringly feminine of all the trees of the Sierra Nevada.   It is interesting to note the differences in the cones, and in the way they grow; singly, in clusters, at the end of branches, on the stems, large, medium-sized, small, short and   300     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   stubby, long and slender, conical, etc. Then, too, while the pines generally have cones every year, the firs seem to miss a year, and to bear only alternate years.   The gray squirrels are often great reapers of the cones, before they are ripe. They cut them down and then eat off the tips of the scales so that they present a pathetically stripped appearance.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXXIII   THE   BIRDS  AND  ANIMALS  OF  THE  TAHOE  REGION   BIRDS.   The bird life of the Tahoe region does not seem particularly interesting or impressive to the casual observer.    At first sight there are not many birds, and those that do appear have neither so vivid plumage nor sweet song as their feathered relatives of the east, south and west.    Nevertheless there are several interesting species, and while this chapter makes no pretense to completeness it suggests what one untrained observer without birds particularly on his mind has witnessed in the course of his several trips to the Tahoe region.   It soon becomes evident that altitude has much to do with bird life, some, as the meadow-lark and blackbird never being found higher than the Lake shore, others at the intermediate elevations where the Alpine hemlock thrives, while still others, such as the rosy finch and the rock-wren, are found only on the highest and most craggy peaks.   While water birds are not numerous in the summer, observant visitors at Lake Tahoe for the first time are generally surprised to find numbers of sea gulls. They fly back and forth, however, to and from their native haunts by the sea. They never raise their young here, generally making their return flight to the shores of the Pacific in September, October and at latest November, to come back in March and April. While out on the mountain in these months, fifty or more miles west of Lake Tahoe I have seen them, high in the air, flying straight to the place they desired.   The blue heron in its solitary and stately watchfulness is   301   302     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   occasionally seen, and again etches itself like a Japanese picture against the pure blue of the sky. The American bittern is also seen rarely.   Kingfishers are found, both on the lakes and streams. It is fascinating to watch them unobserved, perched on a twig, as motionless as if petrified, until, suddenly, their prey is within grasp, and with a sudden splash is seized.   On several of the lakes, occasionally on bays of Tahoe itself, and often in the marshy lands and sloughs of the Upper Truckee, near Tallac, ducks, mallard and teal are found. Mud chickens in abundance are also found pretty nearly everywhere all through the year.   The weird cry of the loon is not infrequently heard on some of the lakes, and one of these latter is named Loon Lake from the fact that several were found there for a number of years.   Flocks of white pelicans are sometimes seen. Blackbirds of two or three kinds are found in the marshes, also killdeer, jacksnipe and the ever active and interesting spotted sandpipers. A few meadow-larks now and again are heard singing their exquisite song, reminding one of Browning's wise thrush which   sings each song twice over, lest you should think he cannot recapture that first fine careless rapture.    Doves are not common, but now and again one may hear their sweet melancholy song, telling us in Joaquin Miller's poetic and exquisite interpretation:   There are many to-morrows, my love, my love, But only one to-day.   In the summer robins are frequently seen. Especially do they revel on the lawns at Tahoe Tavern, their red-breasts and their peculiar   smithing   or   cokeing   just as alluring and interesting as the plumage and voices of the richer feathered and finer songsters of the bird family.   Mountain quails are quite common, and one sometimes sees   THE BIRDS AND ANIMALS              303   a dozen flocks in a day. Grouse are fairly plentiful. One day just on the other side of Granite Chief Peak a fine specimen sailed up and out from the trail at our very feet, soared for quite a distance, as straight as a bullet to its billet for a cluster of pine trees, and there hid in the branches. My guide walked down, gun in hand, ready to shoot, and as he came nearer, two others dashed up in disconcerting suddenness and flew, one to the right, the other to the left. We never got a sight of any of them again.   At another time I was coming over by Split Crag from the Lake of the Woods, with Mr. Price, of Fallen Leaf Lodge, when two beautiful grouse arose from the trail and soared away in their characteristic style.   At one time sage-hens were not infrequent on the Nevada side of the Lake, and as far west as Brockways. Indeed it used to be a common thing for hunters, in the early days, to come from Truckee, through Martis Valley, to the Hot Springs (as Brockways was then named) and shoot sage-hens all along the way. A few miles north of Truckee, Sage Hen Creek still preserves, in the name, the fact that the sage-hen was well known there.   Bald-headed and golden eagles are often seen in easy and circular flight above the highest peaks. In the fall and winter they pass over into the wild country near the almost inaccessible peaks above the American River and there raise their young. One year Mr. Price observed a pair of golden eagles which nested on Mt. Tallac. He and I were seated at lunch one day in September, 1913, on the very summit of Pyramid Peak, when, suddenly, as a bolt out of a clear sky, startling us with its wild rush, an eagle shot obliquely at us from the upper air. The speed with which it fell made a noise as of a   rushing mighty wind.  Down  down, it fell, and then with the utmost grace imaginable, swept up, still going at terrific speed, circled about, and was soon lost to sight.   304     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   Almost as fond of the wind-tossed pines high up on the slopes of the mountain as is the eagle of the most rugged peaks, is Clark's crow, a grayish white bird, with black wings, and a harsh, rasping call, somewhat between that of a crow and the jay.   Of an entirely different nature, seldom seen except on the topmost peaks, is the rosy-headed finch. While on the summit of Pyramid Peak, we saw two of them, and one of them favored us with his (or her) sweet, gentle song.   Hawks are quite common; among those generally seen are the long tailed grouse-hawk, the sparrow hawk, and the sharp-shinned hawk. Night-hawks are quite conspicuous, if one walks about after sunset. They are dusky with a white throat and band on the wing. They sail through the air without any effort, wings outspread and beak wide open, and thus glean their harvest of winged insects as they skim along. Oftentimes their sudden swoop will startle you as they rush by.   Woodpeckers are numerous, and two or three species may be seen almost anywhere in a day's walk through one of the wooded sections. Many are the trees which bear evidence of their industry, skill and providence. The huge crow-like pileolated woodpecker with its scarlet crest, the red-shafted flicker, the Sierra creeper, the red-breasted sap-sucker, Williamson's sap-sucker, the white-headed woodpecker, Cabanis's woodpecker with spotted wings and gray breast, the most common of woodpeckers, and Lewis's woodpecker, a large heavy bird, glossy black above, with a white collar and a rich red underpart, have all been seen for many years in succession.   The red-breasted sap-sucker and Williamson's sap-sucker are found most frequently among the aspens and willows along the lake shore, while the red-shafted flicker, Cabanis's woodpecker, and the white-head favor the woods. One observer says the slender-billed nut-hatch is much more common   THE BIRDS AND ANIMALS              305   than the red-breasted, and that his nasal laugh resounded at all times through the pines.   High up in the hemlock forests is the interesting Alpine three-toed woodpecker. It looks very much like Cabanis's, only it has three toes in place of four, and a yellow crown instead of a black and red one.   In importance after the woodpeckers come the members of the sparrow family that inhabit the Tahoe region. The little black-headed snowbird, Thurber's junco, is the most common of all the Tahoe birds. The thick-billed sparrow, a grayish bird with spotted breast and enormous bill is found on all the brushy hillsides and is noted for its glorious bursts of rich song.   Now and again one will see a flock of English sparrows, and the sweet-voiced song-sparrow endeavors to make up for the vulgarity of its English cousin by the delicate softness of its peculiar song.   Others of the family are the two purple finches (reddish birds), the pine-finch, very plain and streaked, the green-tailed towhee, with its cat-like call, and the white-crowned sparrow,    its sweetly melancholy song,   Oh, dear me,  in falling cadence, is heard in every Sierran meadow.   The mountain song-sparrow, western lark, western chip-ping-fox, gold-finch, and house- and cassin-finches are seen. The fly-catchers are omnipresent in August, though their shy disposition makes them hard to identify. Hammond, olive-sided and western pewee are often seen, and at times the tall tree-tops are alive with kinglets.   Some visitors complain that they do not often see or hear the warblers, but in 1905, one bird-lover reported seven common representatives.    She says:   The yellow bird was often heard and seen in the willows along the Lake. Late in August the shrubs on the shore were alive with the Audubon group, which is so abundant   3o6     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   in the vicinity of Los Angeles all winter. Pileolated warblers, with rich yellow suits and black caps, hovered like hummers among the low shrubs in the woods. Now and then a Pacific yellow-throat sang his bewitching   wichity wichity, wichity, wee.  Hermit and black-throated gray warblers were also recorded. The third week in August there was an extensive immigration of Macgillivray warblers. Their delicate gray heads, yellow underparts, and the bobbing movement of the tail, distinguished them from the others.   The water ouzel finds congenial habitat in the canyons of the Tahoe region, and the careful observer may see scores of them as he walks along the streams and by the cascades and waterfalls during a summer's season. At one place they are so numerous as to have led to the naming of a beautiful waterfall, Ouzel Falls, after them. Another bird is much sought after and can be seen and heard here, perhaps as often as any other place in the country. That is the hermit thrush, small, delicate, grayish, with spotted breast. The shyness of the bird is proverbial, and it frequents the deepest willow and aspen thickets. Once heard, its sweet song can never be forgotten, and happy is he who can get near enough to hear it undisturbed. Far off, it is flute-like, pure and penetrating, though not loud. Gradually it softens until it sounds but as the faintest of tinkling bell-like notes, which die away leaving one with the assurance that he has been hearing the song of the chief bird of the fairies, or of birds which accompany the heavenly lullabies of the mother angels putting their baby angels to sleep.   Cliff-swallows often nest on the high banks at Tahoe City, and a few have been seen nesting under the eaves of the store on the wharf. The nests of barn swallows also have been found under the eaves of the ice-house.   Nor must the exquisite hummers be overlooked. In Truc-kee Canyon, and near Tahoe Tavern they are quite numer-   THE BIRDS AND ANIMALS             307   ous. They sit on the telephone wires and try to make you listen to their pathetic and scarcely discernible song, and as you sit on the seats at the Tavern, if you happen to have some bright colored object about you, especially red, they will flit to and fro eagerly seeking for the honey-laden flower that red ought to betoken.   Several times down Truckee Canyon I have seen wild canaries. They are rather rare, as are also the Louisiana tan-ager, most gorgeous of all the Tahoe birds, and the black-headed grosbeak.   Of the wrens, both the rock wren and the canyon wren are occasionally seen, the peculiar song of the latter bringing a thrill of cheer to those who are familiar with its falling chromatic scale.   Then there is the merry chick-a-dee-dee, the busy creepers, and the nut-hatches hunting for insects on the tree trunks.   The harsh note of the' bluejay is heard from Tahoe Tavern, all around the Lake and in almost every wooded slope in the Sierras. He is a noisy, generally unlovable creature, and the terror of the small birds in the nesting season, because of his well-known habit of stealing eggs and young. At Tahoe Tavern, however, I found several of them that were shamed into friendliness of behavior, and astonishing tameness, by the chipmunks. They would come and eat nuts from my fingers, and one of them several times came and perched upon my shoulder. There is also the grayish solitaire which looks very much like the mockingbird of less variable climes.   The foregoing account of the birds, which I submitted for revision to Professor Peter Frandsen, of the University of Nevada, called forth from him the following:   I have very little to add to this admirable bird account. Besides the gulls, their black relatives, the swallow-like terns,   are   occasionally   seen.   The   black-crowned   night-   308      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   heron is less common than the great blue heron. Clarke's crow is more properly called Clarke's nutcracker     a different genus. The road robin or chewink is fairly common in the thickets above the Lake. Nuttal's poor will, with its call of two syllables, is not infrequently heard at night. The silent mountain blue-bird, sialia arctica, is sometimes seen. So is the western warbling vireo. The solitary white-rumped shrike is occasionally met with in late summer. Owls are common but what species other than the western horned owl I do not know. Other rather rare birds are the beautiful lazuli bunting and the western warbling vireo. Among the wood-peckers I have also noted the bristle-bellied wood-pecker, or Lewis's wood-pecker, Harris's wood-pecker, and the downy wood-pecker.   ANIMALS. These are even more numerous than the birds, though except to the experienced observer many of them are seldom noticed.   While raccoons are not found on the eastern slopes of the High Sierras, or in the near neighborhood of the Lake, they are not uncommon on the western slopes, near the Rubicon and the headwaters of the various forks of the American and other near-by rivers.   Watson assured me that every fall he sees tracks on the Rubicon and in the Hell Hole region of very large mountain lions. They hide, among other places, under and on the limbs of the wild grapevines, which here grow to unusual size. In the fall of 1912 he saw some strange markings, and following them was led to a cluster of wild raspberry vines, among which was a dead deer covered over with fir boughs. In telling me the story he said:   I can generally read most of the things I see in the woods, but this completely puzzled me. I determined to find out all there was to be found. Close by I discovered the fir from which the boughs had been stripped. It was as if some one of giant strength had reached up to a height of seven or eight feet and completely stripped the tree of all   THE BIRDS AND ANIMALS              309   its lower limbs. Then I asked myself the question:   Who's camping here ?  I thought he had used these limbs to make a bed of. But there was no water nearby, and no signs of camping, so I saw that was a wrong lead. Then I noticed that the limbs were too big to be torn off by a man's hands, and there were blood stains all about. Then I found the fragments of a deer.   Now,  I said to myself,   I've got it. A bear has killed this deer and has eaten part of it and will come back for the rest.  You know a bear does this sometimes. But when I hunted for bear tracks there wasn't a sign of a bear. Then I assumed that some hunter had been along, killed a doe (contrary to law), had eaten what he could and hidden the rest, covering the hide with leaves and these branches. But then I knew a hunter would cut off those branches with a knife, and these were torn off. The blood spattered about, the torn-off boughs and the fact that there were no tracks puzzled me, and I felt there was a mystery and, probably, a tragedy.   But a day or two later I met a woodsman friend of mine, and I took him to the spot. He explained the whole thing clearly. As soon as he saw it he said,   That's a mountain-lion.   But,  said I,  Where's his tracks?   He didn't make any,  he replied,   he surprised the doe by crawling along the vines. I've found calves and deer hidden like this before, and I've seen clear traces of the panthers, and once I watched one as he killed, ate and then hid his prey. But as you know he won't touch it after it begins to decompose, but a bear will. And that's the reason we generally think it is a bear that does the killing, when in reality it is a mountain lion who has had his fill and left the remains for other predatory animals, while he has gone off to hunt for a fresh kill.   Occasionally sheep-herders report considerable devastations from mountain-lions and bear to the Forest Rangers. James Bryden, who grazes his sheep on the Tahoe reserve near Downieville, lost sixteen sheep in one night in July, 1911.   There are three kinds each of chipmunks and ground-squirrels.   All of the former have striped backs and do more   3io     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   or less climbing of trees. Of their friendliness, greediness, and even sociability   where nuts are in evidence or anticipated    '   I have written fully in the chapter on Tahoe Tavern. Of the three ground-squirrels the largest is the common ground-squirrel of the valleys of California. It is gray, somewhat spotted on the back, and has a whitish collar and a bushy tail. The next in size is the   picket-pin,  so called from his habit of sitting bolt upright on his haunches and remaining steadfast there, without the slightest movement, until danger threatens, when he whisks away so rapidly that it is quite impossible to follow his movements. In color he is of a grayish brown, with thick-set body, and short, slim tail. He has an exceeding sharp call, and makes his home in grassy meadows from the level of the Lake nearly to the summits of the highest peaks. The   copper-head  is the other ground-squirrel, though by some he may be regarded as a chipmunk, for he has a striped back.   The flying squirrel is also found here. It comes out only at night and lives in holes in trees. On each side between the fore and hind legs it has a hairy flap, which when stretched out makes the body very broad, and together with its hairy tail it is enabled to sail from one tree to another, though always alighting at a lower level. A more correct name would be a   sailing   squirrel. The fur is very soft, of a mouse color and the animal makes a most beautiful pet. It has great lustrous eyes and is about a foot in length.   The tree squirrel about the Lake is the pine squirrel or   chickeree.  The large tree squirrel is abundant on the west slope of the Sierra from about six thousand feet downward, but it is not in the Lake basin, so far as I am aware. The pine squirrel is everywhere, from the Lake side to the summits of the highest wooded peaks. It is dark above, whitish to yellow below, usually with a black line along the side.   The tail is full, bushy, the hairs tipped with white   THE BIRDS AND ANIMALS              3    forming a broad fringe. It feeds on the seeds of the pine cones.   The woodchuck or marmot is a huge, lumbering, squirrel-like animal in the rocky regions, wholly terrestrial and feeding chiefly on roots and grass. The young are fairly good eating and to shoot them with a rifle is some sport.   Of the fur bearing and carnivorous animals the otter, fisher, etc., all are uncommon, though some are trapped every year by residents of the Lake. The otter and mink live along the larger streams and on the Lake shore where they feed chiefly on fish. They may sometimes catch a wild fowl asleep. The martin and fisher live in pine trees usually in the deepest forests, and they probably prey on squirrels, mice and birds. They are usually nocturnal in their habits. The martin is the size of a large tree squirrel; the fisher is about twice that size. The foxes are not often seen, but the coyote is everywhere, a scourge to the few bands of sheep. Often at night his long-drawn, doleful howl may be heard, a fitting sound in some of the wild granite canyons.   One day while passing Eagle Crag, opposite Idlewild, the summer residence of C. F. Kohl, of San Francisco, with Bob Watson, he informed me that, in 1877, he was following the tracks of a deer and they led him to a cave or grotto in the upper portion of the Crag. While he stood looking in at the entrance a snarling coyote dashed out, far more afraid of him than he was surprised at the sudden appearance of the creature.   A few bears are still found in the farther away recesses of the Sierras, and on one mountain range close to the Lake, viz., the one on which Freel's, Job's and Job's Sister are the chief peaks. These are brown or cinnamon, and black. There are no grizzlies found on the eastern slopes of the Sierras, nowadays, and it is possible they never crossed the   312     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   divide from the richer-clad western slopes. In September, 1913, a hunting party, led by Mr. Comstock, of Tallac, and Lloyd Tevis, killed two black bears, one of them weighing fully four hundred pounds, on Freel's Mountain, and in the same season Mr. Carl Flugge, of Cathedral Park, brought home a good-sized cinnamon from the Rubicon country, the skin of which now adorns my office floor.   The grizzly has long since been driven from the mountains, though there may be a few in southern Alpine County, but the evidence is not conclusive. The panther is migratory, preying on young colts and calves. They are not at all common, though some are heard of every year. The   ermine   is pure white in winter, except the tip of the tail, which is black.    It is yellowish brown in summer.   There are two rabbits, one a huge jackrabbit of the great plains region, the other the   snowshoe  rabbit, so called because of his broad furry feet which keep it from sinking into the soft snow in winter. Both rabbits are very rare, and probably both turn white in winter. I have seen specimens of the snowshoe rabbit taken in winter that are pure white.   On the wildest and most desolate peaks and rock piles is found the cony or pika or   rock rabbit   as it is variously called. It is small, only six inches or so in length, tailless but with large round ears and soft grayish fur like a rabbit's.   The jumping mouse is interesting. It may be seen sometimes at evening in swampy areas and meadows. It is yellowish above, whitish below, with an extremely long tail. It travels by long leaps, takes readily to the water and is an expert swimmer. The meadow mice are bluish grey and are found in swampy places. The wood mice are pure white below, brown above and are found everywhere.   Quite a number of badgers are to be found in the Tahoe   THE BIRDS AND ANIMALS              313   region, and they must find abundance of good food, for the specimens I have seen were rolling in fat, and as broad backed as a fourteen inch board.   Several times, also, have I seen porcupines, one of them, weighing fully twenty-five pounds, on the slopes of Mt. Watson, waddling along as if he were a small bear. They live on the tender bark of the mountain and tamarack pines, sometimes girdling the trees and causing them to die. They are slow-gaited creatures, easily caught by dogs, but with their needle spines, and the sharp, quick-slapping action of their tails, by means of which they can thrust, insert, inject     which is the better word?     a score or more of these spines into a dog's face, they are antagonists whose prowess cannot be ignored.   Very few people would think of the porcupine as an animal destructive to forest trees, yet one of the Tahoe Forest rangers reports that in the spring of 1913 fifty young trees, averaging thirty feet high, were killed or ruined by porcupines stripping them of their bark. Sometimes as many as ninety per cent, of the young trees growing on a burned-over area are thus destroyed. They travel and feed at night, hence the ordinary observer would never know their habits.   The bushy-tailed woodrat proves itself a nuisance about the houses where it is as omnivorous an eater as is its far-removed cousin, the house rat. The gopher is one of the mammals whose mark is more often seen than the creature itself. It lives like the mole in underground burrows, coming to the surface only to push up the dirt that it has been digging.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXXIV   THE  SQUAW VALLEY  MINING  EXCITEMENT   THE Tahoe region was once thrilled through and through by a real mining excitement that belonged to itself alone. It had felt the wonderful activity that resulted from the discovery of the Comstock lode in Virginia City. It had seen its southern border crowded with miners and prospectors hurrying to the new field, and later had heard the blasting and picking, the shoveling and dumping of rocks while the road from Placerville was being constructed.   It had seen another road built up from Carson over the King's Canyon grade, and lumber mills established at Glen-brook in order to supply the mines with timbers for their tunnels and excavations, as the valuable ore and its attendant waste-rocks were hauled to the surface.   But now it was to have an excitement and a stampede all its own. An energetic prospector from Georgetown, El Dorado County, named Knox, discovered a big ledge of quartz in Squaw Valley. It was similar rock to that in which the Comstock silver was found in large quantities. Though the assays of the floating-rock did not yield a large amount of the precious metals, they showed a little     as high as  3.50 per ton. This was enough. There were bound to be higher grade ores deeper down. The finder filed his necessary   locations,  and doubtless aided by copious draughts of   red-eye   saw, in swift imagination, his claim develop into a mine as rich as those that had made the mil-   SQUAW VALLEY MINING EXCITEMENT      315   lionaires of Virginia City. Anyhow the rumor spread like a prairie fire, and men came rushing in from Georgetown, Placerville, Last Chance, Kentucky Flat, Michigan Bluff, Hayden Hill, Dutch Flat, Baker Divide, Yankee Jim, Mayflower, Paradise, Yuba, Deadwood, Jackass Gulch and all the other camps whose locators and residents had not been as fortunate financially as they were linguistically.   Knox started a   city  which he named Knoxville, the remains of which are still to be seen in the shape of ruined log-cabins, stone chimneys, foundations of hewed logs, a graveyard, etc., on the left hand side of the railway coming from Truckee, and about six miles from Tahoe.   One has but to let his imagination run riot for a few moments to see this now deserted camp a scene of the greatest activity. The many shafts and tunnels, dump-piles and prospect-holes show how busy a spot it must have been. The hills about teemed with men. At night the log store     still standing     and the saloons     tents, shacks and log houses     were crowded with those who sought in the flowing bowl some surcease from the burden of their arduous labors.   Now and again a shooting took place, a man actually   died with his boots on,  as in the case of one King, a bad man from Texas who had a record, and whose sudden end was little, if any, lamented. He had had a falling out with the store-keeper, Tracey, and had threatened to kill him on sight. The former bade him keep away from his store, but King laughed at the prohibition, and with the blind daring that often counts as courage with such men     for he assumed that the store-keeper would not dare to shoot     he came down the following day, intending himself to do all the shooting there was to be done. But he reckoned mistakenly. Tracey saw him coming, came to the door, bade him Halt  and on his sneering refusal, shot the bad man dead.   In September,  1913, I paid a visit to Knoxville.   Just   316     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   above the town, on the eastern slope of the mountain, were several tunnels and great dump-piles, clearly showing the vast amount of work that had been done. The quartz ledge that caused the excitement was distinctly in evidence, indeed, when the Tahoe Railway roadbed was being graded, this quartz ledge was blasted into, and the director of operations sent a number of specimens for assay, the rock looked so favorable.   Here and there were the remains of old log-cabins, with their outside stone chimneys. In some cases young tamaracks, fifteen and twenty feet high, had grown up within the areas once confined by the walls. These ruins extended all the way down to Deer Creek, showing the large number of inhabitants the town once possessed.   I saw the graveyard by the side of the river, where King's body was the first to be buried, and I stood in the doorway of the store from which the shot that killed him was fired.   In imagination, I saw the whole life of the camp, as I have seen mining-camps after a stampede in Nevada. The shacks, rows of tents, and the rudely scattered and varied dwellings that the ingenuity and skill of men hastily extemporized. Most of the log-houses are now gone, their charred remnants telling of the indifferent carelessness of campers, prospectors or Indians.   The main street was in a pretty little meadowed vale, lined on either side with trees, and close to the Truckee, which here rushes and dashes and roars and sparkles among the bowlders and rocks that bestrew its bed.   When it was found the ore did not   pan out,  the excitement died down even more rapidly than it arose, and in 1863-4 the camp was practically dead.   It has been charged that the Squaw Valley claims were   salted   with ore brought from Virginia City. I am inclined to doubt this, and many of the old timers deny it.   SQUAW VALLEY MINING EXCITEMENT     317   They assert that Knox was   on the square   and that he firmly believed he had paying ore. It is possible there may have been the salting of an individual claim or so after the camp started, but the originators of the camp started it in good faith, as they themselves were the greatest losers when the   bottom   of the excitement dropped out.   About a mile further up the river is still to be seen the site of the rival town of Claraville, founded at the same time as Knoxville. There is little left here, though the assay office, built up against a massive square rock still stands. It is of hewed timbers rudely dovetailed together at the corners.   It would scarcely be worth while to recount even this short history of the long dead,    almost stillborn     Squaw Valley camp were it not for the many men it brought to Lake Tahoe who have left their impress and their names upon its most salient canyons, streams, peaks and other landmarks.    Many  of  these  have  been  referred  to  elsewhere.   One of the first to arrive was William Pomin, the brother of the present captain of the steamer Tahoe. His wife gave birth to the first white child born on Lake Tahoe, and she was named after the Lake. She now lives in San Francisco. When she was no more than two or three months old, her mother took her on mule-back, sixty miles over the trail to Forest Hill, in one day. Pomin removed to the north shore of the Lake when Squaw Valley   busted,  and was one of the founders of Tahoe City, building and conducting one of the first hotels there.   Another of these old timers was J. W. McKinney, from whom McKinney's was named. He came from the mining-camp of Georgetown over the trail, and engaged himself in selling town lots at Knoxville. He and Knox had worked together in the El Dorado excitement.   He originally came over the plains in the gold-alluring   318     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   days of '49. When his party reached the land of the Indians, these aborigines were too wise to make open attacks. They hit upon the dastardly, method of shooting arrows into the bellies of the oxen, so that the pioneers would be compelled to abandon them. One night McKinney was on guard duty. He was required to patrol back and forth and meet another sentinel at a certain tree. There they would stop and chat for a few moments before resuming their solitary march. Just before day-break, after a few words, they separated. On answering the breakfast call McKinney found he was alone, and on going back to investigate, found his companion lying dead with an arrow through his heart. The moccasin tracks of an Indian clearly revealed who was the murderer, and a little study showed that the Indian had swam the river, waited until the sentinel passed close by him, and had then sent the arrow true to its fatal mark.   The next night the Indians shot an arrow into an ox. In the morning it was unable to travel, but McKinney and his friends had determined to do something to put a stop to these attacks. Taking the ox in the shadow of a knoll, they shot it, and eight men then hid in the shelter of some brush where the carcass was clearly in view.   When the train pulled out it seemed as if they had abandoned the ox. It was scarcely out of sight when the watchers saw eight Indians come sneaking up. Each man took the Indian allotted to him, but by some error two men shot at the same Indian, so that when the guns were fired and seven men fell dead the other escaped. On one of them was found seven twenty-dollar gold pieces wrapped up in a dirty rag, which had doubtless cost some poor emigrant or miner his life. Some of the party wished to leave this gold with the dead Indian, but McKinney said his scruples would not allow him to do any such thing, and the gold found its way into his pocket.   SQUAW VALLEY MINING EXCITEMENT      319   Though a man of practically no education     it is even said by those who claim to have known him well that he could neither read nor write, but this seems improbable     he was a man of such keen powers of observation, retentive memory, ability in conversation and strong personality, that he was able to associate on an equality with men of most superior attainments. John Muir was a frequent visitor to his home, especially in the winter time when all tourists and resort guests had gone away. John McGee, another well-known lover of the winter mountains, was also a welcome guest, who fully appreciated the manly vigor and sterling character of the transplanted Missourian.   John Ward, from whom Ward Creek and Ward Peak (8665 feet) are named, was another Squaw Valley mining excitement stampeder. He came in the early days of the rush, and as soon as the camp died down, located on the mouth of the creek that now bears his name.   The next creek to the south     Blackwood's,    is named after still another Squaw Valley stampeder. For years he lived at the mouth of this creek and gained his livelihood as a fisherman.   The same explanation accounts for Dick Madden Creek.   Barker who has peak, pass and valley named after him, came from Georgetown to Knoxville, and like so many other of his unfortunate mining brethren from over the divide, started a dairy on the west side of the pass which bears his name. The valley, however, was so high and cold that more than half the year the cream would not rise, so he gave up dairying and went elsewhere.   These are but a few of many who might be mentioned, whose names are linked with the Tahoe region, and who came to it in the hope of   making their everlasting fortunes   when Squaw Valley   started up.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXXV   THE   FREMONT   HOWITZER  AND   LAKE  TAHOE   HUNDREDS of thousands of Americans doubtless have read   How a Woman's Wit Saved California to the Union,  yet few indeed know how intimately that fascinating piece of history is linked with Lake Tahoe.   Here is the story of the link:   When Fremont started out on his Second Exploration (fairly well dealt with in another chapter), he stopped at the Kansas frontier to equip. When he finally started, the party (108) was armed generally with Hall's carbines, which, says Fremont:   with a brass twelve-pound howitzer, had been furnished to me from the United States arsenal at St. Louis, agreeably to the command of Colonel S. W. Kearny, commanding the third military division. Three men were especially detailed for the management of this, under the charge of Louis Zindel, a native of Germany, who had been nineteen years a non-commissioned officer of the artillery in the Prussian army, and regularly instructed in the duties of his profession.   As soon as the news that he had added a cannon to his equipment reached Washington, the Secretary of War, James M. Porter, sent a message after him, post haste, countermanding the expedition on the ground that he had prepared himself with a military equipment, which the pacific nature of his journey did not require.    It was specially charged as   320   THE FREMONT HOWITZER           321   a heinous offense that he had procured a small mountain howitzer from the arsenal at St. Louis, in addition to his other firearms.   But Fremont had already started. He was not far on his way, and the message could have reached him easily. It was not destined to do so, however, until after his return. The message came to the hands of his girl-wife, Jessie Ben-ton Fremont, the daughter of Missouri's great senator, Thomas H. Benton, and she knew, as Charles A. Moody has well written, that   this order, obeyed, would indefinitely postpone the expedition     probably wreck it entirely. She did not forward it. Consulting no one, since there was no one at hand to consult, she sent a swift messenger to her husband with word to break camp and move forward at once      he could not have the reason for haste, but there was reason enough.  And he, knowing well and well trusting the sanity and breadth of that girl-brain, hastened forward, unquestioning, while she promptly informed the officer whose order she had vetoed, what she had done, and why. So far as human wit may penetrate, obedience to that backward summons would have meant, three years later, the winning of California by another nation     and what that loss would have signified to the United States none can know fully, but any may partly guess who realizes a part of what California has meant for us.   In commenting later upon this countermand of the Expedition Fremont remarks:   It is not probable that I would have been recalled from the Missouri frontier to Washington to explain why I had taken an arm that simply served to increase the means of defense for a small party very certain to encounter Indian hostility, and which involved very trifling expense. The administration in Washington was apparently afraid of the English situation in Oregon.   Unconscious, therefore, of his wife's action,    which might   322     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   easily have ruined his career     Fremont pushed on. The howitzer accompanied him into Oregon, back through into Nevada, and is clearly seen in the picture of Pyramid Lake drawn by Mr. Preuss (which appears in the original report), showing it after it had traveled in the neighborhood of four thousand miles.   The last time it was fired as far as the Fremont Expedition is concerned was on Christmas Eve, in 1843. The party was camped on Christmas Lake, now known as Warner Lake, Oregon, and the following morning the gun crew wakened Fremont with a salute, fired in honor of the day. A month later, two hundred and fifty miles south, it was to be abandoned in the mountains near West Walker River, on account of the deep snow which made it impossible for the weary horses to drag it further.   On the 28th of January Fremont thus writes:   To-night we did not succeed in getting the howitzer into camp. This was the most laborious day we had yet passed through, the steep ascents and deep snows exhausting both men and animals.   Possibly now the thought began to take possession of him that the weapon must be left behind. For long weary days it had been a constant companion. It had been dragged over the plains, mountains and canyons. It was made to ford rivers, plunge through quicksands and wallow through bog, mire, mud, marsh and snow. Again and again it delayed them when coming over sandy roads, but tenaciously Fremont held on to it. Now deep snow forbade its being dragged further. Haste over the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada was imperative, for such peaks and passes are no lady's playground when the forces of winter begin to linger there, yet one can well imagine the regret and distress felt by the Pathfinder at being compelled to abandon this cannon, to   THE FREMONT HOWITZER           323   which he had so desperately clung on all the wearisome miles his company had hitherto marched. On the 29th he writes:   The principal stream still running through an impracticable canyon, we ascended a very steep hill, which proved afterwards the last and fatal obstacle to our little howitzer, which was finally abandoned at this place.  This place appears to be about eight or ten miles up the river from Cole-ville, and on the right or east side of the river.  We passed through a small meadow a few miles below, crossing the river, which depth, swift current, and rock, made it difficult to ford  this brings him to the west bank for the first time, but the cannon did not get this far, and therefore was left on the east side of the river. This is to be noted on account of the fact that it was found on the other side of the river in another canyon , and after a few more miles of very difficult trail, issued into a larger prairie bottom, at the farther end of which we camped, in a position rendered strong by rocks and trees.   The reader must not forget that the notes in brackets     are interjections in Fremont's narrative by Mr. Smith, (see the chapter on Fremont's   discovery of Lake Tahoe).   Fremont continues:   The other division of the party did not come in to-night, but camped in the upper meadow, and arrived the next morning. They had not succeeded in getting the howitzer beyond the place mentioned, and where it had been left by Mr. Preuss, in obedience to my orders; and, in anticipation of the snow-banks and snow-fields ahead, foreseeing the inevitable detention to which it would subject us, I reluctantly determined to leave it there for a time. It was of the kind invented by the French for the mountain part of their war in Algiers; and the distance it had come with us proved how well it was adapted to its purpose. We left it, to the great sorrow of the whole party, who were grieved to part with a companion which had made the whole   324     THE LAKE OF THE SKY--LAKE TAHOE   distance from St. Louis, and commanded respect for us on some critical occasions, and which might be needed for the same purpose again.    It is the impression of those of the old settlers on Walker River, of whom we have inquired regarding the subject, that the cannon was found early in the 6o's near the head of Lost Canyon. This canyon comes into Little Antelope Valley     a branch of Antelope Valley     from the south. This impression evidently was accepted by the government geological surveyors, for they twisted the name of the creek coming down this canyon to   Lost Cannon Creek,  and called a peak, which looks down into this canyon, Lost Cannon Peak. The origin of the name of this canyon lies in the fact that an emigrant party, on its way to the Sonora Pass, and in an endeavor probably to avoid the rough river canyon down which Fremont came, essayed this pass instead of the meadows above. It is a canyon which, at first, promises an easy pass but finally becomes almost impassable. The party in question found it necessary to abandon several of their wagons before they could get over. They, or another party, buried one of their men there, also some blacksmith tools. My endeavors to ascertain what party this was have thus far not been successful. Mr. Timothy B. Smith, who went to Walker River in 1859, says that the wagons were there at that time. The cannon is supposed to have been found with or near these wagons. Mr. Richard Watkins, of Coleville, who went into that section in 1861, or soon after, informs me that wagons were also found in one of the canyons leading to the Sonora Pass from Pickle Meadow. The cannon, according to Mr. Watkins, was found with these wagons. At any rate, it seems likely that the cannon was not found at the place where Fremont left it, but had been picked up by some emigrant party, who, in turn, were compelled to abandon it with several of their wagons.    For several years the cannon remained where its emigrant finders removed it, then at the breaking out of the Civil War,   Dan de Quille,  William Wright, the author of The Big Bonanza, the fellow reporter of Mark Twain on one of the   THE FREMONT HOWITZER            325   Virginia City newspapers, called the attention of certain belligerent adherents of the south to it, and they determined to secure it. But the loyal sons of the Union were also alert and Captain A. W. Pray, who was then in the Nevada mining metropolis, succeeded in getting and maintaining possession of it. As he moved to Glenbrook, on Lake Tahoe, that year, he took the cannon with him. Betng mounted on a carriage with fairly high wheels, these latter were taken and converted into a hay-wagon, with which, for several years, he hauled hay from the Glenbrook meadows to his barn in town. The cannon itself was mounted on a heavy wooden block to which it was affixed with iron bands, securely held in place by bolts and nuts. For years it was used at Glenbrook on all patriotic and special occasions. Fremont never came back to claim it. The government made no claim upon it. So while Captain Pray regarded it as his own it was commonly understood and generally accepted that it was town property, to be used by all alike on occasions of public rejoicing.   After Captain Pray's death, however, the cannon was sold by his widow to the Native Sons of Nevada, and the news of the sale soon spread abroad and caused no little commotion. To say that the people were astonished is to put it mildly. They were in a state of consternation. Fremont's cannon sold and going to be removed? Impossible  No  it was so  The purchasers were coming to remove it the next day.   Were they?   That remained to be seen    That night in the darkness, three or four determined men quietly and stealthily removed the nuts from the bolts, and, leaving the block of wood, quietly carried the cannon and hid it in a car of scrap-iron that was to be transported the next day from Glenbrook to Tahoe City.   When the day dawned and the purchasers arrived, the   326      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   cannon was not to be found, and no one, apparently, knew what had become of it. Solicitations, arguments, threats had no effect. The cannon was gone. That was all there was to it, and Mrs. Pray and the Nevada purchasers had to accept that     to them     disagreeable fact.   But the cannon was not lost. It was only gone on before. For several years it remained hidden under the blacksmith shop at Tahoe City, its presence known only to the few conspirators     one of whom was my informant. About five years ago it was resurrected and ever since then its brazen throat has bellowed the salutation of the Fourth of July to the loyal inhabitants of Tahoe. It now stands on the slight hill overlooking the Lake at Tahoe City, a short distance east of the hotel.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXXVI   THE   MOUNT  ROSE  OBSERVATORY   WHILE Calif ornians rightly and justly claim Ta-hoe as their own, it must not be forgotten that Nevadans have an equal claim.    In the Nevada State University, situated at Reno, there is a magnificent band of young men, working and teaching as professors, who regard all opportunities as sacred trusts, and who are making  for  their  university  a wonderful  record  of  scientific achievement for universal benefit.   Located on the Nevada side of the Tahoe region line, at the northeast end of the Lake, is Mount Rose. It is one of the most salient and important of the peaks that surround Tahoe, its elevation being 10,800 feet. The professor of Latin in the Nevada University, James E. Church, Jr., a strenuous nature-lover, a mountain-climber, gifted with robust physical and mental health, making the ascent of Mt. Whitney in March, 1905, was suddenly seized with the idea that a meteorological observatory could be established on Mt. Rose, and records of temperature, wind, snow or rain-fall taken throughout the winter months. The summit of Mt. Rose by road is approximately twenty miles in a southwesterly direction from Reno, and Professor Church and his associates deemed it near enough for week-end visits. The courage, energy and robust manliness required to carry the work along can be appreciated only by those who have gone over the ground in winter, and forms another chapter of quiet and unknown heroism in the interest of science written by so many of our younger western professors who   327   328      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   are not content with mere academic attainment and distinction.   The idea of obtaining winter temperatures on the mountains of the Pacific Coast was first suggested by Professor McAdie, head of the Weather Bureau in San Francisco.1 He responded to the request for instruments, and through his recommendation, thermometers, rain-gauge, etc., were speedily forthcoming from the Weather Bureau. On June 24, 1905, with   Billy   and   Randy,  family ponies, loaded with a newly designed thermometer-shelter, constructed so as to withstand winter gales and yet allow the easy exit of snow, the first advance on Mt. Rose was made.   From that day the work has been carried on with a vigor and enthusiasm that are thrilling in their inspiration. An improved instrument was added that recorded temperatures on a self-registering roll, all fluctuations, and the highest and lowest temperatures, wind-pressures, all variations in humidity, temperature, and air pressure as well as the directions and the velocity of the wind for periods of seventy days and more. This instrument was the achievement of Professor S. P. Fergusson, for many years a pioneer worker in mountain meteorology at Blue Hill Observatory and an associate of Professor Church at the Mount Rose Observatory, which has now become a part of the University of Nevada.   After two winters' work it was discovered, on making comparisons with the records at the Central Weather Station at Reno, 6268 feet below, that frost forecast could probably be made on Mt. Rose from twenty-four to forty-eight hours in advance of the appearance of the frost in the lower levels, provided the weather current was traveling in its normal course eastward from the coast.   1 Since this was written Professor McAdie has been appointed to the chair of Meteorology at Harvard University.   THE MOUNT ROSE OBSERVATORY     329   Second only in importance was the discovery and photographic recording of evidence of the value of timber high up on mountains, and especially on the lips of canyons, for holding the snow until late in the season.   This latter phase of the Observatory's work has developed into a most novel and valuable contribution to practical forestry and conservation of water, under Dr. Church's clear and logical direction. At Contact Pass, 9000 feet elevation, and at the base of the mountain, supplementary stations have been established, where measurements of snow depth and density, the evaporation of snow, and temperatures within the snow have been taken. Lake Tahoe, with its seventy miles of coast line also affords ready access throughout the winter, by means of motor boat, snow-shoes and explorer's camp, to forests of various types and densities where snow measurements of the highest importance have been made.   Delicate instruments of measurement and weight, etc., have been invented by Dr. Church and his associates to meet the needs as they have arisen, and continuous observations for several years seem to justify the following general conclusions. These are quoted from a bulletin by Dr. Church, issued by the International Irrigation Congress.   The conservation of snow is dependent on mountains and forests and is most complete where these two factors are combined. The mountain range is not only the recipient of more snow than the plain or the valley at its base, but in consequence of the lower temperature prevailing on its slopes the snow there melts more slowly.   However, mountains, because of their elevation, are exposed to the sweep of violent winds which not only blow the snow in considerable quantities to lower levels, where the temperature is higher, but also dissipate and evaporate the snow to a wasteful degree. The southern slopes, also, are so tilted as to be more completely exposed to the direct rays of the sun, and in the Sierra Nevada and probably   330      THE LAKE OF THE SKY     LAKE TAHOE   elsewhere are subjected to the persistent action of the prevailing southwest wind.   On the other hand, the mountain mass, by breaking the force of the wind, causes much of the drifting snow to pile up on its lee slope and at the base of its cliffs, where it finds comparative shelter from the wind and sun.   Forests, also, conserve the snow. In wind-swept regions, they break the force of the wind, catching the snow and holding it in position even on the windward slopes of the mountains. On the lower slopes, where the wind is less violent, the forests catch the falling snow directly in proportion to their openness, but conserve it after it has fallen directly in proportion to their density. This phenomenon is due to the crowns of the trees, which catch the falling snow and expose it to rapid evaporation in the open air but likewise shut out the sun and wind from the snow that has succeeded in passing through the forest crowns to the ground. Both mountains and forests, therefore, are to a certain extent wasters of snow     the mountains because they are partially exposed to sun and wind; the trees, because they catch a portion of the falling snow on their branches and expose it to rapid disintegration. However, the mountains by their mass and elevation conserve immeasurably more snow than they waste, and forested areas conserve far more snow than unforested. If the unforested mountain slopes can be covered with timber, much of the waste now occurring on them can be prevented, and by thinning the denser forests the source of waste in them also can be checked.   The experiences met with by the voluntary band of observers to secure the data needed in their work are romantic in the extreme. An average winter trip requires from a day and a half to two days and a half from Reno. From the base of the mountain the ascent must be made on snow-shoes. When work first began there was no building on the summit, and no shelter station on the way. Imagine these brave fellows, daring the storms and blizzards and fierce temperatures of winter calmly ascending these rugged and steep slopes, in the face of every kind of winter threat, merely to   THE MOUNT ROSE OBSERVATORY     331   make scientific observations. In March, 1906, Professor Johnson and Dr. Rudolph spent the night at timber-line in a pit dug in the snow to obtain protection from a gale, at the temperature of 50 Fahr. below zero, and fought their way to the summit. But so withering was the gale at that altitude even at mid-day, that a precipitate retreat was made to avoid freezing. The faces of the climbers showed plainly the punishment received. Three days later Dr. Church attempted to rescue the record just as the storm was passing. He made his way in an impenetrable fog to 10,000 feet, when the snow and ice-crystals deposited by the storm in a state of unstable equilibrium on crust and trees were hurled by a sudden gale high into the air in a blinding blizzard. During his retreat he wandered into the wildest part of the mountain before he escaped from the skirts of the storm.   Other experiences read like chapters from Peary's or Nan-sen's records in the Frozen North, and they are just as heroic and thrilling. Yet in face of all these physical difficulties, which only the most superb courage and enthusiasm could overcome, Dr. Church writes that, to the spirit, the mountain reveals itself, at midnight and at noon, at twilight and at dawn, in storm and in calm, in frost-plume and in verdure, as a wonderland so remote from the ordinary experiences of life that the traveler unconsciously deems that he is entering another world.   In the last days of October, 1913, I was privileged to make the trip from Reno in the company of Dr. Church, and two others. We were just ahead of winter's storms, however, though Old Boreas raved somewhat wildly on the summit and covered it with snow a few hours after our descent. The experience was one long to be remembered, and the personal touch of the heroic spirit afforded by the trip will be a permanent inspiration.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXXVII   LAKE TAHOE IN WINTER 1   By Dr. J. E. Church, Jr., of the University of Nevada   LAKE TAHOE is an ideal winter resort for the red-blooded. For the Viking and. the near Viking; for the man and the woman who, for the very exhilaration of it, seek the bracing air and the snow-clad forests, Lake Tahoe is as charming in winter as in summer, and far grander. There is the same water     in morning placid, in afternoon foam-flecked, on days of storm tempestuous. The Lake never freezes; not even a film of ice fringes its edge. Sunny skies and warm noons and the Lake's own restlessness prevent. Emerald Bay alone is sometimes closed with ice, but more often it is as open as the outer Lake. Even the pebbles glisten on the beach as far back as the wash of the waves extends.   But beyond the reach of the waves a deep mantle of white clads the forests and caps the distant peaks. The refuse of the forests, the dusty roads, and the inequalities of the ground are all buried deep. A smooth, gently undulating surface of dazzling white has taken their place.   The forest trees are laden with snow     each frond bears its pyramid and each needle its plume of white. The fresh green of the foliage and the ruddy brown of the bark are accentuated rather than subdued by their white setting. But as the eye travels the long vista of ascending and re-   i By courtesy of Sunset magazine.   332   THE FERGUSSON METEOROGRAPH ON THE SUMMIT OF MT.

Above and beyond the forest's utmost reaches rise the mountain crags and peaks, every angle rounded into gentle contours beneath its burden of snow.   Along the margin of the Lake appear the habitations and works of men deeply buried and snow-hooded until they recall the scenes in Whittier's Snow Bound.   The lover of the Lake and its bird life will miss the gulls but will find compensation in the presence of the wild fowl     the ducks and the geese     that have returned to their winter haunts.   Lake Tahoe is remarkably adapted as a winter resort for three prime reasons: first, it is easily accessible; second, no place in the Sierra Nevada, excepting not even Yosemite, offers so many attractions; third, it is the natural and easy gateway in winter to the remote fastnesses of the northern Sierra.   Among the attractions preeminently associated with Lake Tahoe in winter are boating and cruising, snow-shoeing and exploring, camping for those whose souls are of sterner stuff, hunting, mountain climbing, photography, and the enjoyment of winter landscape. Fishing during the winter months is prohibited by law.   If one asks where to go, a bewildering group of trips and pleasures appears. But there come forth speedily from out the number a few of unsurpassed allurement. These are a ski trip from Tallac to Fallen Leaf Lake to see the breakers and the spray driven by a rising gale against the rock-bound shore, and, when the lake has grown quieter, a boat ride to Fallen Leaf Lodge beneath the frowning parapets of Mount Tallac. Next a ski trip up the Glen to the buried hostelry at Glen Alpine, where one enters by way of a dormer win-   334     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   dow but is received to a cheerful fire and with royal hospitality.   Then under the skillful guidance of the keeper, a day's climb up the southern face of Mount Tallac for an unrivalled panoramic view from its summit and a speedy but safe glissade back to the hostelry far, far below.   And if the legs be not too stiff from the glissade, a climb over the southern wall of the Glen to Desolation Valley and Pyramid Peak, whence can be seen the long gorge of the Rubicon. The thousand lakes that dot this region present no barrier to one's progress, for they are frozen over and lie buried deep beneath the snow that falls here in an abundance hardly exceeded elsewhere in the Tahoe region.   A close rival of these is the climb from Rubicon Park up the stately range in its rear to visit the mountain hemlock, the graceful queen of the high mountain, and to gaze across the chasm at the twin crags beyond.   And peer of them all, though requiring but little exertion, is a trip to Brockway to enjoy the unrivalled view of the   Land's End   of the Lake and catch the colors of the pansies that are still in bloom in a niche of the old sea wall. If one possess the artist's mood, he will add thereto a boat ride round State Line Point in the lazy swell of the evening sea beneath the silent pine-clad cliffs, while the moon, as beautiful as any summer moon, rides overhead. Only the carpet of snow and the film of ice that gathers from the spray upon the boat keeps one alive to the reality that the season is winter.   Finally a rowing trip along the western shore of the Lake with stops at pleasure en route. One can have weather to suit his taste, for the waters on this shore are safe in storm, and the barometer and the sky will give full warning long before the weather attains the danger point. The man who loves the breath of the storm and the glow of excitement   LAKE TAHOE IN WINTER              335   will loose his boat from Tallac when the clouds swing down the canyon and speed forth borne, as it were, on the wings of the waves toward the distant foot of the Lake     past the black water wall where the waves of Emerald Bay sweep into Tahoe, through the frothy waters where the wind shifts and whips around Rubicon Point, over the white caps of Meek's Bay until by skillful maneuvering the jutting cape is weathered and quieter water is found in McKinney Bay. Full time there is, with the wind astern, to reach the river's mouth at Tahoe City, but the voyager who loves the woodland will tarry for a night in the dense fir forest of Black-wood, while his boat rides safely moored to the limb of a prostrate tree.   Regarding the eastern side of the Lake, the bald shore and jutting headlands, the fewness of the landing places, and the sweep of the waves make cruising in these waters a matter of supreme skill and farsightedness. Let the Viking learn with broad-beamed boat the mastery of the western shore before he turns his boat's prow to the east.   For the man of milder tastes the motorboat will suffice or the mail steamer, which plies the waters of Lake Tahoe twice a week.   In tobogganing, the hills and open meadows at Tahoe City and at Glenbrook will furnish royal sport for the devotee. Skating and ice-yachting must be sought in regions where the snow is less deep and the cold more intense.   Skiing is the chief method of locomotion in winter at the Lake and the novice soon becomes expert in the milder forms of the sport. Ski trails thread the forests at Tahoe City and radiate from every resort.   The open inns at Tahoe City and Glenbrook, and The Grove near Tallac and the resorts on Fallen Leaf Lake insure the traveler's comfort, while the hospitality of the caretakers at all of the resorts is proverbial.   336      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   The question of when and how to go is naturally a leading one. During the months of November to April, two sledging services are furnished each thrice a week     one from Carson City to Glenbrook, the other from Truckee to Ta-hoe City. (The narrow gauge railway has also established a semi-weekly winter schedule.) The mail boat connects with the incoming sledges and train on Tuesday and Saturday. The route from Carson City, which crosses the heights of the Carson Range, affords a superb view of the Lake at sunset. The route from Truckee traverses the wooded canyon of the Truckee River, when scenically at its best.   The traveler who approaches the Lake by way of Glenbrook and leaves by way of the canyon of the Truckee will have an experience in winter travel both unique and replete with beautiful landscapes.   The journey from Truckee to the Lake can also be made on ski in one short day. It is an exhilarating trip, if one travels light. If one desires to tarry en route, he may carry his blankets and food on his back or haul them on a toboggan, and spend the night at the half-way station, known as Uncle Billy's.   The best time to visit the Lake is after the heaviest of the winter snows have fallen. The period of steady and heavy precipitation occurs in January. After this month is past, there are long periods of settled weather broken only occasionally by storms, which add to rather than detract from one's pleasure.   The special equipment requisite for winter trips to Tahoe is slight. The list includes goggles (preferably amber), German socks and rubbers, woolen shirt, sweater, short heavy coat, and mittens. For mountain climbing a pair of Canadian snowshoes should be added to the equipment; for traveling on the level, a pair of ski can be rented at Truckee   LAKE TAHOE IN WINTER              337   or the Lake. If one desires to camp instead of stopping at the resorts around the Lake, a tent and waterproof sleeping bag should be procured.   The cost of transportation in winter is scarcely more than in summer. The sledge trip from either Truckee or Carson City to the Lake is  2.50, an amount only  1.00 in excess of the regular fare by rail. Board will cost no more than in summer.   TRUCKEE   Closely associated with Lake Tahoe as a center for winter sports is Truckee, the natural point of departure for the Lake. Here a winter carnival is held annually for the entertainment of outsiders. Among the chief sports are ski-racing and jumping and tobogganing. The toboggan course is two thousand feet long and has a fall of one-hundred fifty feet. A device is employed for drawing the toboggans back to the starting point. The hotel facilities are ample. Toboggans and ski can be rented for use here or at the Lake. Clothing and other winter outfits can be procured. Canadian snow-shoes, however, must be obtained in San Francisco.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXXVIII   LAKE TAHOE AS A SUMMER RESIDENCE   ONE of the most marked differences that the traveler observes between the noted lakes of Europe and Lake Tahoe is the comparative dearth of homes, summer villas, bungalows, residences, on the latter.    This is natural.    California and Nevada are new countries.    They have scarcely had time to   find themselves   fully as yet. It took a thousand years to people the shores of the European lakes as we find them to-day, and in due time Tahoe will assuredly come to its own in this regard.    Indeed as John LeConte well wrote a number of years ago:   The shores of Lake Tahoe afford the most beautiful sites for summer residences. When the states of California and Nevada become more populous, the delicious summer climate of this elevated region, the exquisite beauty of the surrounding scenery, and the admirable facilities afforded for fishing and other aquatic sports, will dot the shores of this mountain Lake with the cottages of those who are able to combine health with pleasure. But it must be remembered that the prolonged severity of the winter climate, and especially the great depth of snowfall, render these elevated situations unfit for permanent residences. According to the observations of Dr. G. M. Bourne, during the winter of 1873-74, the aggregate snowfall near the shores of the Lake amounted to more than thirty-four feet. In fact, frequently there are not more than four months in the year in which the ground of the margin of the Lake is entirely free from snow. And the vast gorges which furrow the sides of the surrounding amphitheater of lofty mountain   338   LAKE TAHOE AS A SUMMER RESIDENCE    339   peaks are perpetually snow-clad. Hence, it is unreasonable to assume that many persons besides the wealthy will be able to enjoy the luxury of private residences here, which can be occupied only during the summer months of the year. Nevertheless, when the refinement and taste incident to the development of an older civilization shall have permeated the minds of the wealthy classes of citizens, this charming lake region will not only continue to be the favorite resort of tourists and artists, but will become, during the summer season, the abode of families whose abundant means enable them to enjoy the healthful climate, the gorgeous scenery, and the invigorating sports which lend an inexpressive charm to the sojourn on its shores.   Amidst the magnificent nature that surrounds this region, there should be an inspiration corresponding more or less with the grandeur of the aspect of the material world. The modifications impressed upon the moral and intellectual character of man by the physical aspects of nature, is a theme more properly belonging to those who have cultivated the aesthetic side of humanity. The poet and the artist can alone appreciate, in the fullness of their humanizing influence, the potent effects of these Esthetic inspirations. The lake districts in all Alpine countries seem to impress peculiar characteristics upon their inhabitants.   When quietly floating upon the placid surface of Lake Tahoe, the largest of the   Gems of the Sierra      nestled, as it is, amidst a huge amphitheater of mountain peaks     it is difficult to say whether we are more powerfully impressed with the genuine childlike awe and wonder inspired by the contemplation of the noble grandeur of nature, or with the calmer and more gentle sense of the beautiful produced by the less imposing aspects of the surrounding scenery. On the one hand crag and beetling cliff sweeping in rugged and colossal massiveness above dark waves of pine and fir, far into the keen and clear blue air; the huge mantle of snow, so cumulus-like in its brightness, thrown in many a solid fold over ice-sculptured crest and shoulders; the dark cathedral-like spires and splintered pinnacles, half snow, half stone, rising into the sky like the very pillars of heaven. On the other hand the waving verdure of the valleys below, the dash of waterfalls, the plenteous gush of springs,   340     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   the laugh and dance of brook and rivulet as they hurry down the plains. Add to this picture the deep repose of the azure water, in which are mirrored snow-clad peaks, as well as marginal fringes of waving forests and green meadows, and it is difficult to decide whether the sense of grandeur or of beauty has obtained the mastery of the soul.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XXXIX   THE  TAHOE   NATIONAL   FOREST   THE Tahoe National Forest was first set apart by proclamation, September 17, 1906. Previous to this there had been the Tahoe and Yuba Forest Reserves which were established by proclamation under the acts of March 3, 1891, and June 4, 1897. The original Tahoe Forest Reserve consisted of six townships along the west side of Lake Tahoe. Part of this territory is now in the Tahoe and part in the El Dorado National Forest. Changes and additions were later made by proclamations of March 2, 1909, and July 28, 1910.   Although Lake Tahoe does not lie within any National Forest it is almost surrounded by the Tahoe and El Dorado Forests. There are a few miles of shore-line on the Nevada side in the vicinity of Glenbrook which are not within the National Forest Boundary.   The gross area of the Tahoe National Forest is 1,272,470 acres. Of this amount, however, 692,677 acres are privately owned. The El Dorado National Forest has a gross area of 836,200 acres with 284,798 of them in private hands. These privately owned lands are technically spoken of as   alienated lands.    The towns of Truckee, Emigrant Gap, Cisco, Donner, Fulda, Downieville, Sierra City, Alleghany, Forest, Granite-ville, Goodyear's Bar, and Last Chance, as well as Tahoe City, are all within the Tahoe National Forest.   It is estimated that there are probably 350 people living on the Forest outside of the towns.    These are principally   341   342      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   miners or small ranch-owners living along the rivers in the lower altitudes.   Slowly but surely the people are awakening to the great value of the natural resources that are being conserved in the National Forests. In the Tahoe Reserve the preservation of the forest cover is essential to the holding of snow and rain-fall, preventing rapid run-off, thereby conserving much of what would be waste and destructive flood-water, until it can be used for irrigation and other beneficial purposes.   Many streams of great power possibilities rise and flow, through the Tahoe Forest Reserve, such as the Truckee, Little Truckee, Yuba and American rivers. Working in conjunction with the U. S. Reclamation Service the Truckee General Electric Company uses the water that flows out of Lake Tahoe down the Truckee River for the development of power. The Pacific Gas and Electric Company, of San Francisco, controls the waters of the South Yuba river, and its Colgate plant is on the main Yuba, though it obtains some of its water supply from the North Yuba. Lake Spaulding, one of the largest artificial lakes in the world, is a creation of this same company. It is situated near Emigrant Gap and is used for the development of power.   The Northern Water and Power Company controls the Bowman reservoir and a string of lakes on the headwaters of Canyon Creek, a branch of the South Yuba river. As yet its power possibilities are not developed.   Through the activities of these companies electricity and water for irrigation are supplied to towns and country regions contiguous to their lines, and they have materially aided in the development of the Sacramento Valley.   Only about five per cent, of the Reserve is barren land, and this is mostly situated at a high elevation above timber line.    The tree growth is excellent, and under proper di-   THE TAHOE NATIONAL FOREST       343   rection reproduction could be made all that any one could desire. Fully twenty per cent, however, of the present Reserve is covered with chaparral. Practically all of this originally was timbered. The chaparral has grown up because nothing was done at the proper time to foster reproduction over acres that had been cut. Systematic and scientific efforts are now being made to remedy this condition, the rangers being encouraged to study the trees, gather seeds from the best of their type, plant and cultivate them. Tree cutting is now so regular as to obtain by natural reproduction a second crop on the logged-over areas. Where natural reproduction fails planting is resorted to. Thus it is hoped, in time, to replant all the logged-over areas now owned by the government, serving the double purpose of conserving the water-supply and providing timber for the needs of the future. Much of the timber-land, however, of the Tahoe region, is patented to private owners. Little, if anything, is being done towards reforestation on these private tracts. Legal enactments, ultimately, may produce effective action along this needed line.   As has elsewhere been shown the world owes a debt of gratitude to the Tahoe region. Had it not been for the timber secured so readily from the Tahoe slopes the mining operations of Virginia City, Gold Hill and Dayton would have been seriously retarded and crippled. As it was the Tahoe trees were transferred as mining-timbers for propping up the immense and continuous excavations of that vast series of honey-combings underground, the products of which revivified the gold supply of the world.   Tahoe timber also has contributed much to the upbuilding of the towns and country farms on the whole upper Pacific Coast and interior regions of Northern California, and today much of its timber finds its way to San Francisco and other Pacific Coast markets.   344      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   At Floriston, on the Truckee River, a mill is in successful operation, using Tahoe fir for the making of paper. Red and white fir, which are practically useless for lumber, are found to make excellent wrapping and tissue papers, and thus, from being unremunerative products of our forests, become sources of income. After planing off the bark, the wood is made into small chips, about a half inch square, and an eighth of an inch thick. These chips are then   digested   by a process of mixing with acids and cooking, through which it becomes   wood pulp.  Different processes produce different pulps, two of which are mixed together, allowed to flow out on a very fine wire screen nine feet wide, revolving at a rate of 300 feet a minute, with a   jigging   movement from side to side. This makes all the fibers lie flat. They are then sent through steel rollers, the water squeezed out, and finally carried over and around twenty-five revolving steam-heated cylinders which completely dry the paper and put the needed gloss or finish on it.   The rainfall on the Tahoe Reserve averages about fifty inches annually, the most frequent rains occurring between October and May. Necessarily there is much snow-fall on the higher regions. Further down the snow disappears in the early spring, say March, but in the upper altitudes it remains until late June, with perpetual snow in the sheltered portions of the topmost peaks.   Agriculture, owing to the average high altitude, is a negligible industry in the Reserve, little more being done than to raise a little fruit, grain and vegetables, mainly for home consumption. Naturally there is a fair amount of grazing, almost the whole area of the Reserve being used for this purpose during the summer months. Many portions of meadow-land are used for dairy-herds, most of the hotels and resorts on and near Lake Tahoe having their own herds and meadows.    Bands of beef-cattle are also pastured, to-   THE TAHOE NATIONAL FOREST       345   gether with large bands of sheep, the two kinds of stock often grazing in common, the cattle using the meadows and the sheep the ridges and timber-lands. In taking the trail-rides described in other chapters I invariably came across both cattle and sheep, and all the near-by meadows are occupied by the dairy-herds belonging to the hotels. Patented lands of private ownership within the bounds of the Forest are often also leased to cattle- and sheep-men. Last year it was estimated that there were 47,000 head of sheep, and about 6000 head of cattle on the Reserve. Under the protection of the rangers grazing conditions are rapidly improving, the cattle- and sheep-men being held strictly to certain rules laid down by the Supervisor. Systematic efforts are made to rid the Forest, as far as possible, of predatory animals that kill the sheep, also of poisonous plants which render grazing dangerous.   There are far less cattle on the Sierra ranges in the Tahoe region than there are sheep. During the summer most of the mountain valleys have their great sheep-bands. Many are brought over from Nevada, and far more from the Sacramento Valley and other regions near the Pacific. The feed, as a rule, is good and abundant from the time the snow leaves until the end of September or even later. Though the year 1913 was the third dry season (comparatively speaking) the region had suffered, I found a score or more of meadows in my rambles around Tahoe, where thousands of sheep might have had rich and abundant pasture.   But well may John Muir dislike sheep in his beloved Sierras, and term them in his near-to-hatred   the locusts of the mountains.  When the most fertile valley has been   fed off   by sheep, or they have   bedded down   night after night upon it, it takes some time before the young growth comes up again.   It is the custom when the lambing season is over, and the   346     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   lambs are strong enough to travel and old enough to ship, to move to some convenient point on the railway, where there is an abundance of feed and water on the way, and there ship either to Reno, Carson and Virginia City, or to some market on the Pacific Coast. Hence overland travelers on the Southern Pacific trains are often surprised to see vast flocks of sheep and hear the bleating of the lambs at un-looked for stations at the highest points of the Sierra Nevada, as at Soda. Springs, Cisco, Emigrant Gap, Blue Canyon, or sidings on the way.   There is a large mining industry within the Reserve. Since 1849 the western part of the Forest has been most active, one county, Sierra, having produced since then upwards of  200,000,000. The present output is much smaller than formerly, still it is large enough to render mining an important factor in the productive wealth of the state. In 1853 hydraulic mining was inaugurated near Nevada City. This gave renewed interest to placer-mining.   Four of the old emigrant roads cross the Tahoe and El Dorado Reserves. The most famous of these is the one across Donner Pass and through Emigrant Gap. This was the general course taken by the unfortunate Donner Party, as recorded in another chapter.   Another road was the Heuness Pass road, on a branch of which was Nigger Tent, a rendezvous of robbers and cutthroats in the early days. Prospectors and miners were often robbed and murdered at this place. The Heuness Pass Road and the Donner Road branch in Sardine Valley, the former going through by Webber Lake, and the latter through the present site of Truckee. On the latter road, in the vicinity of You Bet, is a large tree which bears the name   Fremont's Flagpole,  though it is doubtful whether it was ever used by Fremont for this purpose.   The third important road is the present Placervillc Road,   THE TAHOE NATIONAL FOREST       347       a portion of the State Highway and the great trans-continental Lincoln Highway, elsewhere described.   The fourth is the Amador Grade Road, on which stood the tree whereupon Kit Carson carved his name.   The Georgetown Road is an important and historic feature of the Tahoe Region, for it connects Georgetown with Virginia City, and it was from the former place so many Tahoe pioneers came. I have already referred to the trail built in the early 6o's. Then when the Georgetown miners constructed a ditch to convey water for mining purposes from Loon Lake, they soon thereafter, about '72 or '73, built a road about forty miles long, to enable them to reach the Lake, which was their main reservoir. Loon, Pleasant and Bixby's Lakes were all dammed and located upon for the water company.   When the Hunsakers built the road from McKinney's to their Springs in 1883 there was a stretch of only about seven miles from Loon Lake to the Springs to complete a road between Lake Tahoe and Georgetown. The matter was laid before the Supervisors of Placer and El Dorado Counties, and they jointly built the road in 1884, following as nearly as possible the old Georgetown trail, which was practically the boundary between the two counties.   While automobiles have gone over it, it is scarcely good enough for that form of travel, but cattle, sheep and horses are driven over it constantly, campers make good use of it in the summer, and though it has not the activity of the days when it was first built, it has fully justified its existence by the comfort and convenience it gives to the sparsely settled population of the region for which the waters of the Reserve were flumed in every direction. When legal enactment practically abolished placer mining, owing to its ruining the agricultural lands lower down by the carrying of the mud and silt upon them, the water systems were util-   348     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   ized for domestic and irrigation purposes, thus laying the foundation of the great systems now being used for power purposes.   One of the greatest excitements known in the Tahoe region occurred when the first notice of the discovery of the Comstock lode in Virginia City appeared in the Nevada City Journal, July I, 1859. Immediately the whole country was aroused, fully one-third of all the male population setting forth for the mines. This was also one of the great urgents in the building of a railway which soon ultimated in the Central Pacific.   There are several mineral springs of note on the Forest, chief of which are Deer Park Springs, Glen Alpine Springs and Brockway's.   The most northern grove of Big Trees, Sequoia Gigantea, in existence, is found in the Tahoe Forest, on the Forest Hill Divide, near the southern boundary of Placer County, on a tributary of the Middle Fork of the American River. There are six of these trees as well as several which have fallen.   Dotted over the Reserve are cabins of the rangers. These men live a most interesting, and sometimes adventurous and daring life. Primarily their days and nights are largely those of solitude, and it is interesting to throw a little light upon the way they spend their time.   Necessarily their chief thought and care is that of protecting the Forest from fire. To accomplish this end fire-brakes    wide passages, trails, or roads     are cut through the trees and brush, so that it is possible to halt a fire when it reaches one of the constant patrols and watches that are maintained. Lookout stations are placed on elevated points. In the fall of 1911 a Lookout Tower was erected on Banner Mountain, four miles southeast of Nevada City, in which a watchman with a revolving telescope is on duty day and night.    This mountain is at 3900 feet elevation and   OUTLET OF LAKE TAHOE, TRUCKEE RIVER   FLOCK Olf SHEEP BEING DRIVEN FROM THE TAHOE NATIONAL FOREST   ISLAND PARK, LAKE TAHOE   THE TAHOE NATIONAL FOREST       349   affords an unobstructed view of about one-third of the whole area of the Tahoe Forest.   By a system of maps, sights and signals the location of fires can be determined with reasonable accuracy, and the telephone enables warnings to be sent to all concerned.   Telephone lines bisect the Reserve in several directions, and fire-fighting appliances are cached in accessible places ready for immediate use. When a Forest officer is notified of the approximate location of a fire he goes immediately with what help he thinks he needs. If he finds that the fire is larger than he can handle with the available force at his command, he notifies the Supervisor, who secures men from the most practical point and dispatches them to the fire as soon as possible, by automobile or train.   To give further fire protection a gasoline launch     the Ranger     twenty-six feet long and with a carrying capacity of fifteen men, and a speed of about nine miles an hour, was placed on Lake Tahoe in 1910, at the Kent Ranger Station, located a mile below the Tavern. The guard who is in charge of this boat is on the Lake about eight hours each day, going up the Lake in the morning towards Tallac and taking the northern end of the Lake in the afternoon. The launch is put in service each year about the 15 th of June and kept there until the fire-danger is over in the fall. Normal years this is about the 15 th of September, but in 1913 the launch remained and the patrolman was on duty much later.   If the guard sights a fire anywhere within the watershed of Lake Tahoe, he immediately obtains men at the nearest point and proceeds to the fire. Since the launch has been on the Lake there have been no serious fires. Every fire has been caught in its infancy and put out before any damage has been done. There has been only one fire of any size on the Lake since the launch was installed.    This burned about   350     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   20 acres just east of Brockway. Numerous small fires of an acre or less have been put out each year.   The Forest Guard in charge of the launch for the years 1912-13 was Mark W. Edmonds. Mr. Edmonds is the son of Dr. H. W. Edmonds, who is now in the Arctic doing scientific work for the Carnegie Institute.   The force of men at work on the Reserve varies in number according to the season of the year. When the fire-season is on many more men are on duty than in the winter-season. The year-long force consists of the Supervisor, Deputy Supervisor, Forest Clerk, Stenographer, thirteen Rangers and two Forest Examiners who are Forest School men engaged chiefly on timber sale and investigative work. The force in 1913 during the season of greatest danger was fifty-six. Some of the temporary employees are engaged for six months, some for three months and others for shorter periods. The longer termed men are generally Assistant Rangers who cannot be employed the year around, but who are considered first for permanent jobs that occur on the statutory roll on account of their Civil Service standing.   Forest fires are caused in a variety of ways, but chiefly through inexcusable carelessness. Now and then lightning produces fire, but the throwing down of lighted matches by smokers, the butt ends of cigars and cigarettes that are Still alight, leaving camp-fires unextinguished, or building them too large, allowing fires for burning waste land or brush to get from under control     these are the chief sources of forest fires. Accordingly the local and federal authorities constantly keep posted on Forest Reserves notices calling attention to the dangers and urging care upon all who use the forests for any purpose whatever.   In addition to fire-fighting the rangers are required to give constant oversight to the sheep- and cattle-ranges, and to the animals that are brought there, so that the feed is not   THE TAHOE NATIONAL FOREST       351   eaten out, or too many head pastured upon a given area. Seeds of forest trees must be gathered at the proper season and experiments in reforestation conducted, besides a certain amount of actual planting-out performed. The habits of seed-eating birds and animals are studied, especially in relation to reforestation. A very small number of squirrels or mice can get away with a vast number of seeds in a season. Methods of protecting the seeds without destroying too many of the wild animals must be devised.   Available areas of timber are sought for and offered for sale. Certain men are detailed to measure the trees and determine the value of the timber; they must mark the trees included in the sale, leaving out enough seed-trees for satisfactory reproduction. If it be a second sale over a cut-over area the problems are somewhat altered. Will the trees that are left suffer from wind-fall? If partially suppressed trees are left can they be depended upon to recover and make a good growth?   Then, too, the questions of natural versus artificial reforestation have to be scientifically studied and exhaustive tests made. Shall seeds be sown, or shall young trees be planted? Which trees are best suited for certain localities, and which are the more profitable when grown?   To many people it is not known that dwellers in or near National Forests can obtain free of charge timber for their domestic needs. The rangers determine where this   free area   shall be located, exactly what trees, whether dead or alive, shall be taken, and endeavor to lay down rules that shall give equal chances for all comers.   As one of the mottos of the Forest Service is   the greatest good to the greatest number,  small sales are encouraged to those who wish to make their own lumber or shakes. Settlers in remote localities are often helped in this manner.   Cases of trespass have to be guarded against, and now and   352     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   again suits have had to be brought against loggers for encroaching upon the territory of the Reserve, and removing timber which they had not purchased.   In 1911 every District Ranger was appointed a Deputy Fish and Game Commissioner and thus was duly authorized to enforce the law in regard to fish and game.   Another subject of interest and importance to the ranger is the study of insect infestation. Many trees are killed annually by certain insects, and these must be discovered and their devastation prevented.   Then, too, there are diseases and parasites that affect the trees, and this branch of study demands constant attention.   Hence it will be seen that the office of the Forest Ranger is by no means a sinecure. He works hard and he works long and alone and our kindly thoughts should go out to him in his solitary patrols and vigils.   The present Supervisor of the Tahoe Forest is Richard L. P. Bigelow, to whose kindness I am indebted for much of the information contained in this chapter.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER XL   PUBLIC   USE  OF  THE WATERS OF  LAKE  TAHOE   THERE has always been considerable discussion and dissension among conflicting interests as to the use of the waters of Lake Tahoe for private or semi-public uses, and, finally, in 1903 the U. S. Reclamation Service entered into the field.    At my request Mr. D. W. Cole, engineer-in-charge of  the  Truckee-Carson  project,  kindly furnishes the following data:   Along In the 6o's of the last century the region around the Lake acquired great importance on account of the fine growth of timber on the surrounding mountain slopes. It is said that a great many million feet of lumber were harvested in this region. For many years the entire lumber supply for the old Comstock mines was derived from this source. Virginia City, Carson City and the neighboring mining communities were built from the timber of the Lake Tahoe basin, and it might be said that the foundation of the fortunes of the California gold kings, who developed the Comstock mines, was made of the pine wood which grew upon the shores of Lake Tahoe, without which that wonderful output of  700,000,000 of gold from the Comstock lode would have been impossible.   Supplementing the timber supply the water from Mar-lette Lake, a tributary to Lake Tahoe, was diverted by a remarkable engineering achievement for supplying Virginia City and the deep mines. Marlette Lake lies several hundred feet above Lake Tahoe on the Nevada side, and half a century ago its waters were taken through flume, tunnel and pipe line across the dividing mountain range and out into the desert valley of the Carson River for sustaining   353   354     THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   gold seekers of Virginia City. This work of the pioneer engineers was scarcely less bold in its conception and wonderful in its execution than the famous Sutro tunnel which drains the underground waters from the Comstock mines.   About 1870 the first use of Lake Tahoe for other than navigation purposes was made by building a log crib dam at the outlet for the purpose of storing flood-waters to be used in log-driving in the Truckee River below the Lake.   The outlet of the Lake was in a land grant section belonging to the Central Pacific Railway Company, and one of the earlier lumber companies procured a charter from the State of California and proceeded to build a darn and operate it for log-driving purposes.   In the course of time the development of water-power in the Truckee River below the Lake became of considerable importance, both for saw-mill and other manufacturing purposes. The dam at the Lake's outlet was passed from the possession of the Donner Boom   Lumber Company into the hands of other interests who were making a larger use of power.   Eventually, in the last decade of the century, the water-power plants were converted into hydro-electric plants and began to furnish electric current for power and lighting in the city of Reno and as far south as Virginia City.   About the year 1908 the ownership of the several hydroelectric plants was passed to the Truckee River General Electric Company, under the management of the Stone   Webster Engineering Corporation, of Boston, one of the very large public utilities corporations of the country.   This company has enlarged and improved the plants and is now furnishing a large amount of electric current for all purposes in Reno, Virginia City, Carson City, Yerington, Thompson, Minden and various other towns and mining camps in the State of Nevada, forming a group of communities which are wholly dependent upon this power for their various purposes.   In 1903 the United States Reclamation Service filed an appropriation of all surplus waters which had theretofore gone to waste from Lake Tahoe, and under this appropriation, with others covering waters in the Carson River, the   PUBLIC USE OF TAHOE WATERS       355   Truckee-Carson Reclamation Project in Nevada was commenced.   By this irrigation project it is proposed to cover an area of about 206,000 acres, of which 35,000 acres are now being irrigated and about 500 families have their homes upon productive lands, which were formerly a part of the great desert which was traversed with much suffering by the pioneer gold seekers.   In 1908 the Reclamation Service entered into negotiations for the purchase of the real estate and dam controlling the outlet of Lake Tahoe, but before the purchase was concluded the reorganized power company secured possession of the property. A condemnation suit was then brought by the United States to acquire possession and control of the Lake's outlet. A contract was entered into with the power company for the joint building of a new dam with gates for controlling the outlet from the Lake. This dam was partly built in 1909, replacing a portion of the old timber structure. Owing to various complications this new cement dam has stood in an uncomplete condition until the fall of 1913 when arrangements were made for its completion, and now the structure is entirely done and is well adapted to control the outlet from the Lake so as to hold the waters at satisfactory levels according to the various uses for which the water is required.   There have been confusing statements made in the public press and otherwise concerning the intentions and actions of the Reclamation Service and of the power company. The gist of the whole matter is that both the Reclamation Service and the power company have proposed by means of the new dam to regulate the Lake within a range of six feet vertically, this being well within the limits of fluctuations which have occurred during the past 40 years when the Lake has been partially controlled by means of the old logging dam, and during which period the navigation and resort interests have taken the place of the lumber business in the commercial aspects of the Lake.   The records show that during these 40 years the Lake has fluctuated to the extent of a little more than eight feet between low and high water marks.   356      THE LAKE OF THE SKY    LAKE TAHOE   The landowners around the Lake are principally interested in its esthetic qualities as a basis for the commercial interests involved in the tourist traffic and summer resort business. These interests would naturally desire the Lake to be held at a fixed level.   Likewise the navigation interests which operate a large number of boats of various sizes would be best pleased with a stationary level of the Lake, in order that their wharves and boat routes might be built and maintained for a single level of the water.   On the other hand the natural conditions and the use of water for power and irrigation, which are among the older vested rights, require the Lake to be used to some extent as a storage reservoir, which implies a fluctuating level.   The whole problem is to reconcile these various interests so as to derive the greatest possible economic advantages while maintaining the great beauties of the Lake for those whose interests lie mainly in that direction.   There has been suspicion on the part of some of the riparian owners that either the power company or the Government, or both, have been entertaining ulterior motives with the purpose of drawing down the Lake to unprecedented levels and of extracting from the Lake an amount of water greater than the average annual inflow. It may be stated once for all that there has never been such a purpose and that all calculations of the available water in the Lake have been based upon a long record of seasonable fluctuations which prove that the average annual outflow from the Lake is about 300,000 acre feet.   All plans have contemplated the use of only this average amount of water annually.   The Lake has an area of 193 square miles. The elevation of its high-water mark has been at 6231.3, whereas its low-water mark is recorded at elevation 6223.1 above sea level.   Should the Government be successful in acquiring the outlet property from the power company by the condemnation suit now in court, it is proposed to operate the gates of the dam at all times so as to maintain the Lake at the highest level consistent with the maintenance of a desirable shore-line and the conservation of water for the public utili-   PUBLIC USE OF TAHOE WATERS       357   ties. It is proposed never to draw the Lake below the previous low-water mark or to allow it to rise as high as the previous high-water mark, at which low and high limits damage in some degree was done to one or another's interests at the Lake.   The regulation proposed by the Government provides for recognition and protection of all rights in and to the waters and shores of Lake Tahoe, including the rights of the general public and of the lovers of natural beauty everywhere, and it is believed that the charms, as well as the utilities, of this paragon of lakes can more safely be entrusted to a permanent government agency than to any single private interest.   A few additions to Mr. Cole's lucid statement will help the general reader to a fuller comprehension of the difficulty as between the States of Nevada and California. It will be recalled that Lake Tahoe has an area of about 193 square miles, of which 78 square miles are in the counties of Washoe, Ormsby and Douglas, Nevada, the remaining 115 square miles being in Placer and El Dorado Counties, California.   Because of this fact, that nearly two-thirds of the superficial area of the Lake is in California, the people of California claim that they have the natural and inherent right to control, even to determining of its disposal at least nearly two-thirds of the water of the Lake.   The situation, however, is further complicated by the fact that the only outlet to the Lake is in California near Tahoe City, in Placer County, into the Truckee River, which meanders for some miles in a northeasterly course until it leaves California, enters Nevada, passes through the important city of Reno, and finally empties into Pyramid Lake, which practically has no outlet.   In response to the claim of California, the people of Nevada, in which it appears they are backed up by the U. S. Reclamation Service, contend that Nature has already determined whither the overflow waters of Lake Tahoe shall go.   358      THE LAKE OF THE SKY     LAKE TAHOE   That, while they do not wish in the slightest to restrict the proper use of the waters of the Truckee River by the dwellers upon that river, they insist that no one else is entitled to their use, and that every drop of superfluous water, legally and morally, belongs to them, to be used as they deem proper. In accordance with this conception of their rights the Nevada legislature passed the following act, which was approved, March 6, 1913:   That for the purpose of aiding the Truckee-Carson reclamation project now being carried out by the Reclamation Service of the United States of America, under the Act of Congress approved June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. p. 384), known as the Reclamation Act, and acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, consent is hereby given to the use by the United States of America of Lake Tahoe, situated partly in the State of California and partly in the State of Nevada, and the waters, bed, shores and capability of use for reservoir purposes thereof, in such manner and to such extent as the United States of America through its lawful agencies shall think proper for such purpose, and as fully as the State of Nevada could use the same, provided, however, that the consent hereby given is without prejudice to any existing rights that persons or corporations may have in Lake Tahoe or the Truckee River.   At the present time (winter of 1914   15) the matter is in the courts awaiting adjudication, which it is to be hoped, while being satisfactory to all parties to the suit, will fully conserve for the scenic enjoyment of the world all the charms for which Tahoe has been so long and so justly famous.

        <pagetext>APPENDIX CHAPTER A  MARK TWAIN  AT  LAKE  TAHOE  EARLY in the 'sixties the immortal Mark made his mark at Lake Tahoe.    In his Roughing It, he devotes Chapters XXII and XXIII to the subject. With the kind consent of his publishers, Harper Bros, of New York, the following extracts are presented.  Later, when in Italy, he described Lake Como and compared it with Tahoe in Innocents Abroad, and while his prejudices against the Indians led him to belittle the Indian name     Tahoe     and in so doing to make several errors of statement, the descriptions are excellent and the interested reader is referred to them as being well worthy his attention.  Chapter XXII, Roughing It.    We had heard a world of talk about the marvelous beauty of Lake Tahoe, and finally curiosity drove us thither to see it. Three or four members of the Brigade 1 had been there and located some timber lands on its shores and stored up a quantity of provisions in their camp.   We strapped a couple of blankets on our shoulders  1 The   Brigade   to which the distinguished humorist here refers was a company of fourteen camp-followers of the Governor of Nevada, who boarded at the same house as Mark, that of Mrs. O'Flannigan. They had joined the Governor's retinue  by their own election at New York and San Francisco, and came along, feeling that in the scuffle for little territorial crumbs and offices they could not make their condition more precarious than it was, and might reasonably expect to make it better. They were popularly known as the ' Irish Brigade,' though there were only four or five Irishmen among them.   359  360                              APPENDIX  and took an ax apiece and started     for we intended to take up a wood ranch or so ourselves and become wealthy. We were on foot. The reader will find it advantageous to go on horseback. We were told that the distance was eleven miles. We tramped a long time on level ground, and then toiled laboriously up a mountain about a thousand miles high and looked over. No lake there. We descended on the other side, crossed the valley and toiled up another mountain three or four thousand miles high, apparently, and looked over again. No lake yet. We sat down tired and perspiring, and hired a couple of Chinamen to curse those people who had beguiled us. Thus refreshed, we presently resumed the march with renewed vigor and determination. We plodded on, two or three hours longer, and at last the Lake burst upon us     a noble sheet of blue water lifted six thousand three hundred feet above the level of the sea, and walled in by a rim of snowclad mountain peaks that towered aloft full three thousand feet higher still  It was a vast oval, and one would have to use up eighty or a hundred good miles in traveling around it. As it lay there with the shadows of the mountains brilliantly photographed upon its still surface I thought it must surely be the fairest picture the whole earth affords.  . . . After supper as the darkness closed down and the stars came out and spangled the great mirror with jewels, we smoked meditatively in the solemn hush and forgot our troubles and our pains. In due time we spread our blankets in the warm sand between two large bowlders and soon fell asleep. . . . The wind rose just as we were losing consciousness, and we were lulled to sleep by the beating of the surf upon the shore.  It is always very cold on that Lake shore in the night, but we had plenty of blankets and were warm enough. We never moved a muscle all night, but waked at early dawn in the original positions, and got up at once thoroughly refreshed, free from soreness, and brim full of friskiness. There is no end of wholesome medicine in such an experience. That morning we could have whipped ten such people as we were the day before     sick ones at any rate. But the world is slow, and people will go to   water cures   and   movement cures  and to foreign lands for health.  MARK TWAIN AT LAKE TAHOE        361  Three months of camp life on Lake Tahoe would restore an Egyptian mummy to his pristine vigor, and give him an appetite like an alligator. I do not mean the oldest and driest mummies, of course, but the fresher ones. The air up there in the clouds is very pure and fine, bracing and delicious. And why shouldn't it be?     It is the same the angels breathe. I think that hardly any amount of fatigue can be gathered together that a man cannot sleep off in one night on the sand by its side. Not under a roof, but under the sky; it seldom or never rains there in the summer time.  . . . Next morning while smoking the pipe of peace after breakfast we watched the sentinel peaks put on the glory of the sun, and followed the conquering light as it swept down among the shadows, and set the captive crags and forests free. We watched the tinted pictures grow and brighten upon the water till every little detail of forest, precipice, and pinnacle was wrought in and finished, and the miracle of the enchanter complete.    Then to   business.   That is, drifting around in the boat. We were on the north shore. There, the rocks on the bottom are sometimes gray, sometimes white. This gives the marvelous transparency of the water a fuller advantage than it has elsewhere on the Lake. We usually pushed out a hundred yards or so from the shore, and then lay down on the thwarts in the sun, and let the boat drift by the hour whither it would. We seldom talked. It interrupted the Sabbath stillness, and marred the dreams the luxurious rest and indolence brought. The shore all along was indented with deep, curved bays and coves, bordered by narrow sand-beaches; and where the sand ended, the steep mountain-sides rose right up aloft into space     rose up like a vast wall a little out of the perpendicular, and thickly wooded with tall pines.  So singularly clear was the water, that where it was only twenty or thirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct that the boat seemed floating in the air  Yes, where it was even eighty feet deep. Every little pebble was distinct, every speckled trout, every hand's-breadth of sand. Often, as we lay on our faces, a granite bowlder, as large as a village church, would start out of the bottom apparently, and seem climbing up rapidly to the surface, till pres-  362                           APPENDIX  ently it threatened to touch our faces, and we could not resist the impulse to seize an oar and avert the danger. But the boat would float on, and the bowlder descend again, and then we could see that when we had been exactly above it, it must have been twenty or thirty feet below the surface. Down through the transparency of these great depths, the water was not merely transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so. All objects seen through it had a bright, strong vividness, not only of outline, but of every minute detail, which they would not have had when seen simply through the same depth of atmosphere. So empty and airy did all spaces seem below us, and so strong was the sense of floating high aloft in mid-nothingness, that we called these boat-excursions   balloon-voyages.   We fished a good deal, but we did not average one fish a week. We could see trout by the thousand winging about in the emptiness under us, or sleeping in shoals on the bottom, but they would not bite     they could see the line too plainly, perhaps. We frequently selected the trout we wanted, and rested the bait patiently and persistently on the end of his nose at a depth of eighty feet, but he would only shake it off with an annoyed manner, and shift his position.1  1 These extracts are made from Mark Twain's copyrighted works by especial arrangement with his publishers, Harper   Bros., New York.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER B   MARK TWAIN AND THE  FOREST RANGERS   IN a quarterly magazine published solely for the Rangers of   the   Tahoe   Reserve,   one   of   the   Rangers   thus   newspaperizes   Mark's experiences in two different sketches, one as it was in 1861   before   the establishment of the Reserve, and the other as it would be   now.    AS  IT  WAS IN   1861   Extract from January Harper's.    Mark Twain heard that the timber around Lake Bigler (Tahoe) promised vast wealth which could be had for the asking. He decided to locate a timber claim on its shores. He went to the Lake with a young Ohio lad, staked out a timber claim, and made a semblance of fencing it and of building a habitation, to comply with the law. They did not sleep in the house, of which Mark Twain says:   It never occurred to us for one thing, and besides, it was built to hold the ground, and that was enough.    We did not wish to strain it.    They lived by their camp-fire on the borders of the Lake and one day     it was just at nightfall     it got away from them, fired the Forest, and destroyed their fence and habitation. His picture of the superb night spectacle     the mighty mountain conflagration     is splendidly vivid.     The level ranks of flame were relieved at intervals by the standard-bearers, as we called the tall dead trees, wrapped in fire, and waving their blazing banners a hundred feet in the air. Then we could turn from the scene to the Lake and see every branch and leaf, and cataract of flame upon its banks perfectly reflected, as in a gleaming, fiery mirror. The mighty roaring of the conflagration, together with our solitary and somewhat unsafe position (lot   363   364                              APPENDIX   there was no one within six miles of us), rendered the scene very impressive.    AS IT WOULD  BE   NOW   Press Dispatch,   August 15, 1912.   MARK TWAIN FIRES FOREST        NOTED    HUMORIST    CHARGED    BY    FOREST    OFFICERS    WITH CRIMINAL  CARELESSNESS   Mark Twain and a friend from Ohio, who have been camping on Lake Tahoe, are responsible for a Forest fire which burned over about 200 acres before it was checked by Forest officers. The fire was sighted at 6 o'clock p. M. by one of the cooperative patrolmen of the Crown Columbia Paper Company, who at once telephoned to the tender of the Launch ' Ranger' for help. Within an hour the launch was on the scene with a dozen men picked up at Tahoe City, and by 10 o'clock the fire was practically under control.   Twain and his friend were found spell-bound by the Rangers, at the impressiveness of the fire. After fighting it for several hours, however, its grandeur palled upon them, and at the present time they are considerably exercised inasmuch as it was ascertained that the fire was a result of their carelessness in leaving a camp-fire to burn unattended. It is extremely likely that the well-known humorist will find the penalty attendant to his carelessness, no   joking   matter.   To which I take the liberty of adding the following:   SUBSEQUENT   PROCEEDINGS   From the Nevada City Bulletin, Sept. 6, 1912.   Samuel L. Clemens (popularly known as Mark Twain), together with Silas Snozzlebottom, of Columbus, Ohio, was to-day arraigned before Justice Brown, of the Superior Court, charged with having caused a destructive fire by leaving  his campfire  unattended.   The  eminent  humorist   MARK TWAIN AND THE RANGERS     365   and author was evidently unaware of the seriousness of his offense for he positively refused to engage an attorney to defend him. When called upon to plead he began to explain that while he confessed to lighting the fire, and leaving it unattended, he wished the Judge to realize that it was the act. of God in sending the wind that spread the flames that caused the destructive fire which ensued. The Judge agreed with him, and then grimly said it was a similar act of God which impelled him to levy a fine of  500.00 and one month in jail for leaving his campfire subject to the influence of the wind. The humorist began to smile   on the left,  and expressed an earnest desire to argue the matter out with the Judge, but with a curt   Next Case    Mark was dismissed in charge of an officer and retired   smiling a sickly smile,  and though he did not   curl up on the floor,  it is evident that the subsequent proceedings interested him no more.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER C   THOMAS  STARR  KING  AT   LAKE  TAHOE   IN 1863 Thomas Starr King, perhaps the most noted and broadly honored divine ever known on the Pacific Coast, visited Lake Tahoe, and on his return to San Francisco preached a sermon, entitled:   Living Water from Lake Tahoe.     Its descriptions are so felicitous that I am gratified to be able to quote them from Dr. King's volume of Sermons Christianity and Humanity, with the kind permission of the publishers, Houghton, Mifflin Company, Boston, Mass.   LIVING  WATER   FROM   LAKE  TAHOE   When one is climbing from the west, by the smooth and excellent road, the last slope of the Sierra ridge, he expects, from the summit of the pass, which is more than seven thousand feet above the sea, higher than the famous pass of the Splugen, or the little St. Bernard, to look off and down upon an immense expanse. He expects, or, if he had not learned beforehand, he would anticipate with eagerness, that he should be able to see mountain summits beneath him, and beyond these, valleys and ridges alternating till the hills subside into the eastern plains. How different the facts that await the eye from the western summit, and what a surprise   We find, on gaining what seems to be the ridge, that the Sierra range for more than a hundred miles has a double line of jagged pinnacles, twelve or fifteen miles apart, with a trench or trough between, along a portion of the way, that is nearly fifteen hundred feet deep if we measure from the pass which the stages traverse, which is nearly three thousand feet deep if the plummet is dropped from the highest points of the snowy spires.   366   THOMAS STARR KING AT LAKE TAHOE     367   Down into this trench we look, and opposite upon the eastern wall and crests, as we ride out to the eastern edge of the western summit. In a stretch of forty miles the chasm of it bursts into view at once, half of which is a plain sprinkled with groves of pine, and the other half an expanse of level blue that mocks the azure into which its guardian towers soar. This is Lake Tahoe, an Indian name which signifies   High Water.  We descend steadily by the winding mountain-road, more than three miles to the plain, by which we drive to the shore of the Lake; but it is truly Tahoe,   High Water.  For we stand more than a mile, I believe more than six thousand feet above the sea, when we have gone down from the pass to its sparkling beach. It has about the same altitude as the Lake of Mount Cenis (6280 feet) in Switzerland, and there is only one sheet of water in Europe that can claim a greater elevation (Lake Po de Vanasque, 7271 feet). There are several, however, that surpass it in the great mountain-chains of the Andes and of Hindustan. The Andes support a lake at 12,-000 feet above the sea, and one of the slopes of the Himalaya, in Thibet, encloses and upholds a cup of crystal water 15,600 feet above the level of the Indian Ocean, covering an area, too, of 250 square miles. I had supposed, however, that within the immense limits of the American Republic, or north of us on the continent, there is no sheet of water that competes with Tahoe in altitude and interest. But in Mariposa County of our State there are two lakes, both small,   one 8300 feet, and the other 11,000 feet,    on the Sierra above the line of the sea.   To a wearied frame and tired mind what refreshment there is in the neighborhood of this lake  The air is singularly searching and strengthening. The noble pines, not obstructed by underbrush, enrich the slightest breeze with aroma and music. Grand peaks rise around, on which the eye can admire the sternness of everlasting crags and the equal permanence of delicate and feathery snow. Then there is the sense of seclusion from the haunts and cares of men, of being upheld on the immense billow of the Sierra, at an elevation near the line of perpetual snow, yet finding the air genial, and the loneliness clothed with the charm of feeling the sense of the mystery of the mountain heights,   368                           APPENDIX   part of a chain that link the two polar seas, and of the mystery of the water poured into the granite bowl, whose rim is chased with the splendor of perpetual frost, and whose bounty, flowing into the Truckee stream, finds no outlet into the ocean, but sinks again into the land.   Everything is charming in the surroundings of the mountain Lake; but as soon as one walks to the beach of it, and surveys its expanse, it is the color, or rather the colors, spread out before the eye, which holds it with greatest fascination. I was able to stay eight days in all, amidst that calm and cheer, yet the hues of the water seemed to become more surprising with each hour. The Lake, according to recent measurement, is about twenty-one miles in length, by twelve or thirteen in breadth. There is no island visible to break its sweep, which seems to be much larger than the figures indicate. And the whole of the vast surface, the boundaries of which are taken in easily at once by the range of the eye, is a mass of pure splendor. When the day is calm, there is a ring of the Lake, extending more than a mile from shore, which is brilliantly green. Within this ring the vast center of the expanse is of a deep, yet soft and singularly tinted blue. Hues cannot be more sharply contrasted than are these permanent colors. They do not shade into each other; they lie as clearly defined as the course of glowing gems in the wall of the New Jerusalem. It is precisely as if we were looking upon an immense floor of lapis lazuli set within a ring of flaming emerald.   The cause of this contrast is the sudden change in the depth of the water at a certain distance from shore. For a mile or so the basin shelves gradually, and then suddenly plunges off into unknown depths. The center of the Lake must be a tremendous pit. A very short distance from where the water is green and so transparent that the clean stones can be seen on the bottom a hundred feet below, the blue water has been found to be fourteen hundred feet deep; and in other portions soundings cannot be obtained with a greater extent of line.   What a savage chasm the lake-bed must be  Empty the water from it and it is pure and unrelieved desolation. And the sovereign loveliness of the water that fills it is its color. The very savageness of the rent and fissure is made the con-   THOMAS STARR KING AT LAKE TAHOE     369   dition of the purest charm. The Lake does not feed a permanent river. We cannot trace any issue of it to the ocean. It is not, that we know, a well-spring to supply any large district with water for ordinary use. It seems to exist for beauty. And its peculiar beauty has its root in the peculiar harshness and wildness of the deeps it hides.   Brethren, this question of color in nature, broadly studied, leads us quickly to contemplate and adore the love of God. If God were the Almighty chiefly,    if he desired to impress us most with his omnipotence and infinitude, and make us bow with dread before him, how easily the world could have been made more somber, how easily our senses could have been created to receive impressions of the bleak vast-ness of space, how easily the mountains might have been made to breathe terror from their cliffs and walls, how easily the general effect of extended landscapes might have been monotonous and gloomy  If religion is, as it has so often been conceived to be, hostile to the natural good and joy which the heart seeks instinctively,    if sadness, if melancholy, be the soul of its inspiration, and misery for myriads the burden of its prophecy,    I do not believe that the vast deeps of space above us would have been tinted with tender azure, hiding their awfulness; I do not believe that storms would break away into rainbows, and that the clouds of sunset would display the whole gamut of sensuous splendor; I do not believe that the ocean would wear such joy for the eye over its awful abysses; I do not believe that the mountains would crown the complete, the general loveliness of the globe.   The eloquent preacher then continues to draw other lessons from the Lake, but, unfortunately, our space is too limited to allow quotation in full. The following, however, are short excerpts which suggest the richness of the fuller expression:   The color of the Lake is a word from this natural Gospel. It covers the chasms and wounds of the earth with splendor. It is what the name of the lovely New Hampshire lake, Winnepesaukee indicates,   The Smile of the Great Spirit.    And this color is connected with purity.   The green ring   370                              APPENDIX   of the Lake is so brilliant, the blue enclosed by it is so deep and tender, because there is no foulness in the water. The edge of the waves along all the beach is clean. The granite sand, too, often dotted with smooth-washed jaspers and garnets and opaline quartz, is especially bright and spotless. In fact, the Lake seems to be conscious, and to have an instinct against contamination. Several streams pour their burden from the mountains into it; but the impurities which they bring down seem' to be thrown back from the lip of the larger bowl, and form bars of sediment just before they can reach its sacred hem. Dip from its white-edged ripples, or from its calm heart, or from the foam that breaks over its blue when the wind rouses it to frolic, and you dip what is fit for a baptismal font,   you dip purity itself.   The purity of nature is the expression of joy, and it is a revelation to us that the Creator's holiness is not repellent and severe. God tries to win you by his Spirit, which clothes the world with beauty, to trust him, to give up your evil that you may find deeper communion with him, and to recognize the charm of goodness which alone is harmony with the cheer and the purity of the outward world.   I must speak of another lesson, connected with religion, that was suggested to me on the borders of Lake Tahoe. It is bordered by groves of noble pines. Two of the days that I was permitted to enjoy there were Sundays. On one of them I passed several hours of the afternoon in listening, alone, to the murmur of the pines, while the waves were gently beating the shore with their restlessness. If the beauty and purity of the Lake were in harmony with the deepest religion of the Bible, certainly the voice of the pines was also in chord with it.   I read under the pines of Lake Tahoe, on that Sunday afternoon, some pages from a recent English work that raises the question of inspiration. Is the Bible the word of God, or the words of men? It is neither. It is the word of God breathed through the words of men, inextricably intertwined with them as the tone of the wind with the quality of the tree. We must go to the Bible as to a grove of evergreens, not asking f6r cold, clear truth, but for sacred influence, for revival to the devout sentiment, for the   THOMAS STARR KING AT LAKE TAHOE     371   breath of the Holy Ghost, not as it wanders in pure space, but as it sweeps through cedars and pines.   In my Sunday musing by the shore of our Lake, I raised the question,    Who were looking upon the waters of Ta-hoe when Jesus walked by the beach of Gennesareth? Did men look upon it then? And if so were they above the savage level, and could they appreciate its beauty? And before the time of Christ, before the date of Adam, however far back we may be obliged to place our ancestor, for what purpose was this luxuriance of color, this pomp of garniture? How few human eyes have yet rested upon it in calmness, to drink in its loveliness  There are spots near the point of the shore where the hotel stands, to which not more than a few score intelligent visitors have yet been introduced. Such a nook I was taken to by a cultivated friend. We sailed ten miles on the water to the mouth of a mountain stream that pours foaming into its green expanse. We left the boat, followed this stream by its downward leaps through uninvaded nature for more than a mile, and found that it flows from a smaller lake, not more than three miles in circuit, which lies directly at the base of two tremendous peaks of the Sierra, white with immense and perpetual snow-fields. The same ring of vivid green, the same center of soft deep blue, was visible in this smaller mountain bowl, and it is fed by a glorious cataract, supported by those snow-fields, which pours down in thundering foam, at one point, in a leap of a hundred feet to die in that brilliant color, guarded by those cold, dumb crags.   Never since the creation has a particle of that water turned a wheel, or fed a fountain for human thirst, or served any form of mortal use. Perhaps the eyes of not a hundred intelligent spirits on the earth have yet looked upon that scene. Has there been any waste of its wild and lonely beauty? Has Tahoe been wasted because so few appreciative souls have studied and enjoyed it? If not a human glance had yet fallen upon it, would its charms of color and surroundings be wasted charms?   Where we discern beauty and yet seclusion, loveliness and yet no human use, we can follow up the created charm to   372                              APPENDIX   the mind of the Creator, and think of it as realizing a conception or a dream by him. He delights in his works. To the bounds of space their glory is present as one vision to his eye. And it is our sovereign privilege that we are called to the possibility of sympathy with his joy. The universe is the home of God. He has lined its walls with beauty. He has invited us into his palace. He offers to us the glory of sympathy with his mind. By love of nature, by joy in the communion with its beauty, by growing insight into the wonders of color, form, and purpose, we enter into fellowship with the Creative art. We go into harmony with God. By dullness of eye and deadness of heart to natural beauty, we keep away from sympathy with God, who is the fountain of loveliness as well as the fountain of love. But the inmost harmony with the Infinite we find only through love, and the reception of his love. Then we are prepared to see the world aright, to find the deepest joy in its pure beauty, and to wait for the hour of translation to the glories of the interior and deeper world.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER D   JOSEPH  LECONTE AT LAKE TAHOE   JrOSEPH  LeCONTE, from whom LeConte Lake is named, the best-beloved professor of the       University of California, and its most noted geologist, in the year 70 started out with a       group of students of his geology classes, and made a series of Ramblings in the High       Sierras. These were privately printed in 1875, and from a copy given to me many years ago       by the distinguished author, I make the following extracts on Lake Tahoe:   August 20, (1870). I am cook to-day. I therefore got up at daybreak and prepared breakfast       while the rest enjoyed their morning snooze. After breakfast we hired a sail-boat, partly       to fish, but mainly to enjoy a sail on this beautiful Lake.   Oh  the exquisite beauty of this Lake     its clear waters, emerald-green, and the deepest       ultramarine blue; its pure shores, rocky or cleanest gravel, so clean that the chafing of       the waves does not stain in the least the bright clearness of the waters; the high granite       mountains, with serried peaks, which stand close around its very shore to guard its       crystal purity,    this Lake, not among, but on, the mountains, lifted six thousand feet       towards the deep-blue overarching sky, whose image it reflects  We tried to fish for       trout, but partly because the speed of the sail-boat could not be controlled, and partly       because we enjoyed the scene far more than the fishing, we were unsuccessful, and soon       gave it up. We sailed some six or eight miles, and landed in a beautiful cove on the       Nevada side. Shall we go in swimming? Newspapers in San Francisco say there is something       peculiar in the waters of this high mountain Lake. It is so light, they say, that logs of       timber sink immediately, and bodies   373   374                              APPENDIX   of drowned animals never rise; that it is impossible to swim in it; that, essaying to do       so, many good swimmers have been drowned. These facts are well attested by newspaper       scientists, and therefore not doubted by newspaper readers. Since leaving Oakland, I have       been often asked by the young men the scientific explanation of so singular a fact.   1  have uniformly answered,   We will try scientific experiments when we arrive there.           That time had come.      Now then, boys,  I cried,   for the scientific experiment I       promised  you       I  immediately plunged in head-foremost and struck out boldly.    I       then threw myself on my back, and lay on the surface with my limbs extended and motionless       for ten minutes, breathing quietly the while.    All the good swimmers quickly followed.          It is as easy to swim and float in this as in any other water.    Lightness from       diminished atmospheric   pressure?   Nonsense     In   an   almost   incompressible liquid       like water, the diminished density produced by   diminished  pressure  would   be  more         than   counterbalanced by increased density produced by cold.   After our swim, we again launched our boat, and sailed out into the very middle of the       Lake. The wind had become very high, and the waves quite formidable. We shipped wave after       wave, so that those of us who were sitting in the bows got drenched. It was very exciting.       The wind became still higher; several of the party got very sick, and two of them       cascaded. I was not in the least affected, but, on the contrary, enjoyed the sail very       much.    About   2  p. m. we concluded it was time to return, and therefore tacked about for camp.   The wind was now dead ahead, and blowing very hard. The boat was a very bad sailer, and so       were we. We beat up against the wind a long time, and made but little headway. Finally,       having concluded we would save time and ' patience by doing so, we ran ashore on the beach       about a mile from camp and towed the boat home. The owner of the boat told us that he       would not have risked the boat or his life in the middle of the Lake on such a day.         Where ignorance is bliss,  etc.   After a hearty supper we gathered around the fire, and the young men sang in chorus until       bedtime.   Now then, boys,  cried I,   for a huge camp-fire, for it will be cold to-   JOSEPH LeCONTE AT LAKE TAHOE       375   night   We all scattered in the woods, and every man returned with a log, and soon the       leaping blaze seemed to overtop the pines. We all lay around, with our feet to the fire,       and soon sank into deep sleep.   August 21. Sunday at Tahoe  I wish I could spend it in perfect quiet. But my underclothes       must be changed. Cleanliness is a Sunday duty. Some washing is necessary. Some of the       party went fishing to-day. The rest of us remained in camp and mended or washed clothes.   At 12 M. I went out alone, and sat on the shore of the Lake, with the waves breaking at my       feet. How brightly emerald-green the waters near the shore, and how deeply and purely blue       in the distance  The line of demarcation is very distinct, showing that the bottom drops       off suddenly. How distinct the mountains and cliffs all around the Lake; only lightly       tinged with blue on the farther side, though more than twenty miles distant    How greatly is one's sense of beauty affected by association   Lake Mono is surrounded by       much grander and more varied mountain scenery than this; its waters are also very clear,       and it has the advantage of several very picturesque islands; but the dead volcanoes, the       wastes of volcanic sand and ashes covered only by interminable sagebrush, the bitter,       alkaline, dead, slimy waters, in which nothing but worms live; the insects and flies which       swarm on its surface, and which are thrown upon its shore in such quantities as to infect       the air,    all these produce a sense of desolation and death which is painful; it destroys       entirely the beauty of the lake itself; it unconsciously mingles with and alloys the pure       enjoyment of the incomparable mountain scenery in its vicinity. On the contrary, the       deep-blue, pure waters of Lake Tahoe, rivaling in purity and blueness the sky itself; its       clear, bright emerald shore-waters, breaking snow-white on its clean rock and gravel       shores; the Lake basin, not on a plain, with mountain scenery in the distance, but       counter-sunk in the mountain's top itself,    these produce a never-ceasing and       ever-increasing sense of joy, which naturally grows into love. There would seem to be no       beauty except as associated with human life and connected with a sense of fitness for       human happiness. Natural beauty is but the type of spiritual beauty.   376                           APPENDIX   Enjoyed a very refreshing swim in the Lake this afternoon. The water is much less cold       than that of Lake Tenaya or the Tuolumne River, or even the Nevada River.   The party which went out fishing returned with a very large trout.    It was delicious.   I observe on the Lake ducks, gulls, terns, etc., and about it many sandhill cranes     the       white species, the clanging cry of these sounds pleasant to me by early association.   August 22. Nothing to do to-day. Would be glad to sail on the Lake or fish, but too       expensive hiring boats. Our funds are nearly exhausted. Would be glad to start for home,       but one of our party     Pomroy     has gone to Carson City, and we must wait for him.   I went down alone to the Lake, sat down on the shore and enjoyed the scene. Nothing to do,       my thoughts to-day naturally went to the dear ones at home. Oh  how I wish they could be       here and enjoy with me this lovely Lake  I could dream away my life here with those I       love. How delicious a dream  Of all the places I have yet seen, this is the one I could       longest enjoy and love the most. Reclining thus in the shade, on the clean white sand, the       waves rippling at my feet, with thoughts of Lake Tahoe and of my loved ones mingling in my       mind, I fell into a delicious doze.    After my doze I returned to camp, to dinner.   About 5 p. M. took another and last swim in the Lake.   Pomroy, who went to Carson, returned 7 p. m. After supper, again singing in chorus, and       then the glorious camp-fire.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER E   JOHN  VANCE  CHENEY  AT LAKE  TAHOE   ONE of America's poets who long lived in California, and then,  after an honorable and useful sojourn as Director of one of the important libraries of the East, returned to spend the remainder of his days     John Vance Cheney     in 1882, made the trip to Lake Tahoe by stage from Truckee, and, among other fine pieces of   description,   wrote   the   following  which   appeared   in Lippincott's for August, 1883:   One more ascent has been made, one more turn rounded, and behold, from an open elevation, close upon its shore, Lake Tahoe in all its calm beauty bursts suddenly upon the sight. Nestled among the snowy summit-peaks of the Sierra Nevada, more than six thousand feet above sea-level, it lies in placid transparency. The surrounding heights are all the more pleasing to the eye because of their lingering winter-cover; and as we gaze upon the Lake, unruffled by the gentlest breeze, we marvel at the quiet,    almost supernatural,    radiancy of the scene. Lakes in other lands may present greater beauty of artificial setting,    beauty dependent largely upon picturesqueness, where vineyards and ivied ruins heighten the effect of natural environment,    but for nature pure and simple, for chaste beauty and native grandeur, one will hesitate before naming the rival of Lake Tahoe. This singularly impressive sheet of water, one of the highest in the world, gains an indescribable but easily-perceived charm by its remoteness, its high, serene, crystal isolation. Its lights and shades, its moods and passions, are changing, rapid, and free as the way of the wind.   A true child of nature, it varies ever, from hour to hour   377   378                             APPENDIX   enchanting with new and strange fascination. The thousand voices of the lofty Sierra call to it, and it answers; all the colors of the rainbow gather upon it, receiving in their turn affectionate recognition. Man has meddled with it little more than with the sky; the primeval spell is upon it, the hush, the solitude of the old gods. The breath of powers invisible, awful, rouse it to the sublimity of untamable energy; again, hush it into deepest slumber. Night and day it is guarded, seemingly, by wonder-working forces known to man only through the uncertain medium of the imagination. The traveler who looks upon Lake Tahoe for a few hours only learns little of its rich variety. Like all things wild and shy, it must be approached slowly and with patience.   But our sketch must not include more than the hasty glimpses of a day. The stage conveyed us directly to the wharf, which we reached at ten o'clock, having accomplished our fourteen mile ride up the valley in about two and a half hours. As we boarded the little steamer awaiting us and looked over its side into the water below, the immediate shock of surprise cannot be well described. Every pebble at the bottom showed as distinctly as if held in the open hand. We had all seen clear water before, but, as a severe but unscholarly sufferer once said of his rheumatism,   never such as these/' The day being perfect, no breeze stirring, and the Lake without a ripple, the gravelly bottom continued visible when we had steamed out to a point where the water reached a depth of eighty feet. Two gentlemen on board who had made a leisurely trip round the world and were now on their way home to England, remarked that they had seen but one sheet of water (a lake in Japan) of anything like equal transparency. It is presumed that they had not visited Green Lake, Colorado.   Our course lay along the California shore, toward its southern extremity, the steamer stopping at several points for exchange of mail. These stopping places are all summer-resorts, where the guests, snugly housed at the base of the mountain-range, divide the time between lounging or rambling under the shadow of the tall pines and angling for the famous Tahoe trout in the brightness of the open Lake. All looked inviting, but we were not wholly enchanted un-   JOHN VANCE CHENEY AT LAKE TAHOE     379   til, gliding past many a snowy peak, we suddenly changed course and put into Emerald Bay. This little bay, or rather lake in itself, about three miles in length, is the gem of the Tahoe scenery. Through its narrow entrance, formed by perpendicular cliffs some two thousand feet high, we moved on toward an island of rock and a succession of flashing waterfalls beyond.   For a time the dazzling mountain-crests and glistening gorges absorbed attention. So high, white, silent  We longed to be upon the loftiest one, from the top of which can be seen thirteen charming little mountain-lakes, midair jewels, varying in feature according to the situation. Two of these lakes, widely dissimilar in character, are but two miles distant from Tallac House, a comfortable resort at the base of the noble peak from which it takes its name.   But not even the crystal summit ridges delighted us as did the changing waters in the path of the steamer. Following immediately upon the transparency preserved to a depth, of some eighty feet, a blur passed over the surface. This changed by imperceptible degrees to a light green. The green, again, speedily deepened, shading into a light blue; and finally, in deepest water (where the Lake is all but fathomless), the color becomes so densely blue that we could not believe our eyes. Indigo itself was outdone. Description fails; the blue deep of Tahae must be seen to be appreciated.   The ride from Glenwood back to Tahoe City was not so calm. The Lake was considerably agitated; less so, however, than on the following day, when, as we learned afterward, our little steamer lost its rudder. Owing to the gorges in the mountains upon either side, through which winds rush unexpectedly, Tahoe has her dangers. She is a wild, wayward child, but thoroughly lovable throughout all her frowns as well as smiles, equally captivating in her moments of unconquerable willfulness as in her seasons of perfect submission. Reaching Tahoe City at four o'clock, we found the stage standing in readiness, and, with a last, hasty look at the Lake, we were soon on our way by the banks of the Truckee, back to town.

        <pagetext>CHAPTER F   THE  RESORTS   OF  LAKE  TAHOE   IN the body of this book I have given full account of some of the resorts of the Tahoe       region, including Deer Park Springs, Tahoe Tavern, Fallen Leaf Lodge, Cathedral Park, Glen       Alpine Springs, Al-Tahoe, Lakeside, Glenbrook and Carnelian Bay.   But these are by no means all the resorts of the Bay, and each year sees additions and       changes. Hence I have deemed it well briefly to describe those resorts that are in       operation at the time this volume is issued.   It should be remembered that each resort issues its own descriptive folder, copies of       which may be obtained from the ticket offices of the Southern Pacific Railway, the Lake       Tahoe Railway and Transportation Company, or the Peck-Judah Information Bureau, as well as       from its own office. All the resorts not already described in their respective chapters       are reached by steamer on its circuit around the Lake, as follows:   HOMEWOOD   The first place for the steamer after leaving the Tavern is Homewood, a comparatively new       resort, but already popular and successful, conducted by Mr. and Mrs. A. W. Jost. This is       six miles from Tahoe City. The hotel was built in 1913 and has hot and cold water piped to       all rooms.   In addition there are cottages of two and three rooms, which, together with single and       double tents, provide for   380   THE RESORTS OF LAKE TAHOE        381   every taste and purse. The tents are protected by flies, have solid boarded floors, are       well carpeted, and afford the fullest opportunity for out-door sleeping. Homewood       possesses a gently sloping and perfectly safe bathing beach for adults and children. It       also boasts a unique feature in an open-air dancing platform, with old-fashioned music. It       owns its power-boat for excursions on the Lake, and its fleet of row-and fishing-boats. A       campfire is lighted nightly during the season, and song and story cheer the merry hours       along.   For circulars address A. W. Jost, Homewood, Lake Tahoe, Calif.   mckinney's   Three and a half to four miles beyond Homewood is McKinney's. This is one of the oldest       and best-established resorts on the Lake, having been founded and long conducted by that       pioneer of Lake Tahoe, J. W. McKinney, as fully related elsewhere. It is now under the       management of Murphy Brothers and Morgan, and is essentially a place that is popular with       the crowd. The resort was built, as are all the older places, to meet ever-increasing       needs, the main hotel being supplemented by numerous cottages and tents. McKinney's has a       fine new dancing-hall, dark-room for amateur photographers, iron and magnesia springs,       fleet of fishing- and motor-boats, free fishing-tackle, etc., and during the season its       accommodation for two hundred guests is more than taxed to the limit.   For circular address Murphy Brothers and Morgan, McKinney's, Lake Tahoe, Calif.   MOANA  VILLA   The next steamer stopping-place, about two hundred yards from McKinney's is Moana Villa,       the comfortable, unpretentious and homelike resort conducted by Mr. and   382                             APPENDIX   Mrs. R. Colwell, who are also the owners of Rubicon Springs, reached by daily stage during       the summer season, nine miles from McKinney's.   Owning its own ranch in the mountains where milk, cream, butter, eggs, poultry and game       are plentiful, the table at Moana Villa is provided with all the substantials and       luxuries, cooked and served in home style.   One great advantage is offered to guests at Moana Villa, viz.: they may divide their time       between it and Rubicon Springs, as both are under the same ownership and management.   The new Scenic Automobile Boulevard passes through the 700 acres of delightful       surroundings which belong to the place. The best fishing grounds on Lake Tahoe are close       by and numerous smaller mountain lakes and streams afford excellent fly fishing. Deer,       bear, grouse, quail, ducks, geese and other game abound in the locality.   Hunting, fishing, bathing, boating, dancing, launch trips, beautiful walks and drives and       numerous games give ample opportunity for amusement and recreation. The assembly hall and       office is of logs. Sleeping accommodations in cottages and tents or out of doors if       desired. Water is piped from a clear mountain spring, and an equipment of up-to-date       sanitary plumbing, bath and toilet appliances has been lately installed.   For circular address R. Colwell, Moana Villa, Lake Tahoe, Calif.   pomin's   A little beyond Moana Villa is Pomin's, the latest acquisition to the resorts of the Lake,       having been opened in 1914. The hotel is an attractive, well-equipped, up-to-date       structure, located on a knoll 150 feet from the Lake, and is surrounded by pines.          Enclosed verandas, open fires in lobby   THE RESORTS OF LAKE TAHOE        383   and dining-rooms, electric lights, hot and cold water in all the rooms, tents and cottages       are some of the conveniences and luxuries.   There is an attractive club-house on the Lake Shore. For circular address Frank J. Pomin,       Pomin's, Lake Tahoe, Calif.   Emerald Bay Camp and Al-Tahoe have both been described in their respective chapters.   TALLAC   As explained in Chapter XVIII, Tallac House was built by E. J. (Lucky) Baldwin. For many       years it was the principal hotel on the Lake, but what was a fine and superior hotel 25       years ago did not satisfy the demands of modern patrons. Hence some years ago Mr. Baldwin       planned to erect a new hotel near the site of the old one. Unfortunately the work was not       much more than begun when he died and nothing has been done to it since.   The hotel is now under the management of a San Francisco firm.   PINE  FOREST  INN   Built, as its name implies, in a pine grove of trees, this is one of the older resorts of       the Lake. It is unique in that it keeps open throughout the year. Like the rest of the       resorts of its class it has hotel and dining-room with cottages and tents. Under its new       management a new casino has been built, and every room and cottage, etc., equipped with       electric lights. Especial attention is given to camping-, fishing-, and hunting-parties.       It is on the State Highway between Placerville and Carson City, Nevada, and therefore       makes all provision for automobilists.   For circular address Lawrence   Comstock, Pine Forest Inn, Tallac P. O., Calif.   384                           APPENDIX   CAMP   BELL   Located between Al Tahoe and Bijou is Camp Bell, conducted by Russell W. Bell. The camp       consists of tents and an open-air dining-room.   For circular address Russell W. Bell, 128 Edgewood Ave., San Francisco, Calif.   BIJOU  INN   This is another well-known Inn and Camp at the southeastern end of the Lake. It is on the       Lake Shore Drive near to the State Highway and close to Freel's and the other mountain       peaks of this group. The beach in front of Bijou is of clean white sand, with a gentle       slope, offering excellent facilities for bathing.   For circular address W. F. Conolley, Bijou, Lake Tahoe, Calif.   Lakeside Park and Glenwood have each been described in their respective chapters.   BROCKWAYS   This oldrestablished and popular hot-springs resort is on the north end of the Lake,       beautifully situated on State-Line Point between Crystal and Agate Bays. The hot springs       and mineral swimming-pool here have a tested quality which thousands of guests can testify       to, and they are annually patronized by a large number. The resort and springs are under       the management of the owner.   For circular, address F. B. Alverson, Brockways, Lake Tahoe, Calif.   TAHOE  VISTA   On the shores of Agate Bay a new resort was started two years ago, known as Tahoe Vista.       It has a modern hotel, equipped for convenience and comfort.   THE RESORTS AT LAKE TAHOE        385   Bathing, boating and fishing in Agate Bay at Tahoe Vista is at its best. The white sanded       beach is broad and is safe to the smallest child, the bay being shallow for a distance of       five hundred feet from its edge and affording a temperature to the water that is more       pleasant than to be found at any other part of the Lake.   The fame of Lake Tahoe's trout fishing is world renowned, and in Agate Bay that sport is       superior. One of the public fish hatcheries is located near Tahoe Vista, insuring a       constant supply of the most favored varieties of game fish. Twenty-five thousand Eastern       brook trout were recently placed in Griff Creek, a lively little stream that dances       through the glens of Tahoe Vista.   To those who wish to own their own homes on the Lake Tahoe Vista affords excellent       opportunities in that lots are for sale at moderate rates. A direct automobile road       connects with Truckee, and also with Tahoe Tavern.   For circular address Manager Hotel, Tahoe Vista, Calif.   Carnelian Bay and its attractions are fully described in its own chapter.   TAHOE CITY   This is the starting and the ending point of the steamer trip around the Lake. It is a       historic place, the first town founded on Lake Tahoe, and destined ultimately to come into       large importance. There is a small hotel, together with housekeeping cottages, and free       camping facilities.   For full particulars address Tahoe Development Co., Tahoe, Calif.

    <description>Segment 46 – Reducing Ski Area Erosion        Air date: 12/16/03                Anchor Intro: One of the biggest contributors of Lake Tahoe’s declining water clarity is dirt and sediment flowing into the lake. And, all that dirt and sediment gets into the lake from erosion. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a look at how area ski resorts are trying to control erosion on the slopes.                ((Take pkg))                ((Track 1)) An experiment is underway at Squaw Valley. The purpose: to figure out what is the best way to control erosion.                ((S/U @ 13:03, Shelly Purdy)) “A field of grass like this may look like good erosion control, but the ground underneath is so compacted that when water comes down it runs off of it very quickly.”                ((sot @ 7:45ish Michael Hogan, Erosion Control Specialist)) “Part of erosion control is the ability of water to infiltrate into the soil. And what we’re finding on some of these soils up here is the water doesn’t infiltrate very well so it’ll run between the grasses and still erode.”                ((track 2)) So they’re experimenting with a variety of methods to try to make the ground more porous. These different plots have been treated in different ways. Some have had mulch tilled into the soil, other areas have had mulch and wood chips added and tilled.                 ((sot @ 9:05) “What we’re essentially trying to do is find out what really controls erosion rather than what grows grasses on these slopes.”                ((track 3)) And they’re having some success. They set up a rain machine on these test plots and let the water flow.                 ((sot @ 8:27)) “We were able to infiltrate the rainfall rate of up to 5 inches and hour in some of those areas whereas in the areas where there is a lot of grass but didn’t have the organic material in the soil we could only infiltrate that amount of rain for maybe only a few minutes than it would start to runoff.”                ((Track 4)) It will take more time and research to figure out which method works best to control erosion. The results of this experiment will be shared with other ski resorts. With the lake tahoe environmental education coalition, I’m shelly purdy for kolo news channel 8.

Over the past decade, the Cave Rock General Improvement District has applied for and been awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in grant money to build erosion control projects like a neighborhood drainage system with a sediment basin that catches dirty runoff before it flows to Tahoe. With all that work being done on the public lands in and around the Cave Rock subdivision, residents here decided it was important to also do their part on their own private property.

    <description>Segment 48 - Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)                Air Date: 12/30/03                                                Anchor Intro: T-M-D-L is an acronym you’re going to be hearing a lot about in the coming years when people talk about Lake Tahoe. Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                                TAKE PKG                                ((Track 1)) TMDL stands for Total Maximum Daily Load. It’s a technical way to call the amount of sediment and other contaminants that can flow into Lake Tahoe every day without negatively affecting the clarity. Scientists measure clarity with the aid of a secchi disk. By watching the disk as it goes deeper and deeper into the water, they can measure just how clear Lake Tahoe is. Currently that depth is about 67 feet. The goal is to turn back the clock by three decades and achieve a clarity depth of 90 feet.                                ((sot @ 3:22 Dave Roberts, Lahontan Water Resource Board))                “The TMDL is looking to determine a more accurate estimation of the current pollutant load and also tell us what needs to be reduced in order to achieve historic clarity of Lake Tahoe.”                                ((track 2)) To figure that out, policy makers are looking at the data collected from the dozens of research projects currently underway at Tahoe. Researchers are measuring the effects of nearshore turbidity, stream channel erosion, sediment loading from stormwater, and algae growth. The results of these experiments will help determine just how much dirt and grime Lake Tahoe can take. Once that level is established, it will be up to the agencies, communities and property owners at Tahoe to figure out a way to meet those standards.                                ((sot @ 5:25))                “As long as we can achieve the required pollutant load reduction then we’re okay with strategies that demonstrate they can achieve that pollutant load reduction.”                                ((Track 3)) The overall goal is to make Tahoe clearer and bluer that it is today. The important part isn’t how they do it…just that it gets done. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.

    <description>Segment 49 – NDOT Snow Removal        Air Date: 1/6/04                Anchor Intro: It’s that time of year again when snow plows rule the road and salt and sand collect on your car. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy shows us how the Nevada Department of Transportation is trying to keep that sand and salt from polluting Lake Tahoe.                TAKE PKG                ((@:40 natpop getting sand out of the storage building))                ((Track 1)) When a storm’s on its way, there’s a lot going on at the NDOT yard. Plows are filled with sand and sent out on the road. But the sand that’s used these days at Lake Tahoe and throughout Washoe County is very different from what was put down on the road a few years ago. It’s a tougher rock called “spec D” sand.                 ((sot @ 4:23, Thor Dyson, NDOT district Engineer))        “The sand doesn’t break down into very small powdery particles that would either fly up into the air causing an air quality problem or a sand that would break down in solution and go towards Lake Tahoe.”                ((Track 2)) Aside from the new sand, NDOT is also using technology to help them keep Tahoe blue.                ((s/u @ 22:15, Shelly Purdy))        “There are ten of these high tech road weather stations on the Nevada side of the lake. They tell operators whether the roads are wet, dry, icy or snowy and that information is used to determine just how much sand and salt gets put on the roads.”                ((sot @ 7:46))        “Our total storm management also includes the picking up and sweeping of sand off the roadway surface as well as ditches as well as sediment trap basins and facilities that actually catch the sand.”                ((track 3)) As soon as the sun comes out and the roads start to dry those sweepers are sent out. Removing the sand after each storm reduces the amount that will wash into storm drains which flow into the lake. By using a different grade of sand, limiting the amount that gets put on the roads and taking it off immediately after a storm, NDOT has reduced the amount of roadway pollution they contribute to Lake Tahoe by up to 75%. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                Anchor Tag: NDOT also takes the sand off the roadways immediately after a storm as a safety precaution for drivers. Too much sand on the road can cause friction issues and create unsafe driving conditions.</description>

    <description>Segment 50 – Tahoe Interagency Information Management System (TIIMS)        Air Date: 1/13/04                Anchor Intro: Just about anything you want to know about Lake Tahoe from water quality data to weather history is now available on the internet. Shelly Purdy has details in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((track 1)) The Tahoe Integrated Information Management System, or TIIMS, is now up and running and available to the public. TIIMS is a clearing-house of sorts where you can find anything and everything about Lake Tahoe. The topics available on TIIMS include: air quality, water quality, fisheries information, wildlife information, transportation and more. TIIMS pulls together data and research from various agencies and organizations and puts it all in one easily accessible place.                ((sot @ 8:03, Tricia York, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))        “TIIMS is actually a system that was intended to stop redundancy and duplicative efforts among the scientists, among the agencies, the technical and management agencies. This was a system that we would all have a shared understanding of what is going on in the basin.”                ((track 2)) Users who log-on to TIIMS can access raw data from a wide variety of research projects, or they can read summaries about each topic.                 ((sot @ 5:17))        “TIIMS is as broad and general or as deep and in depth as you are willing to explore it to be to answer the questions that you or your organization have.”                ((track 3)) The TIIMS website has been three years in the making and is still a work in progress. The TRPA is asking for public input on the system.                ((sot @ 6:22))        “We’re hoping for people to log-on to the system…check it out and see if it works.”                ((Track 4)) And, hopefully you’ll learn something about Lake Tahoe you didn’t know before. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                Anchor Tag: The TIIMS website can be accessed at www.tiims.org.</description>

    <description>Segment 51: “Snowmobiles”                Anchor Intro: Snowmobiling is fast becoming one of the most popular forms of winter recreation in our area. With the growth in the sport in the Tahoe region comes environmental concerns and worries about how the powerful machines will mix with cross country skiers and snowshoers. Shelly Purdy has more in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take Pkg))                ((Nats – revving up and taking off))        ((Track 1)) The Tahoe Meadows recreation area at the top of Mount Rose is a snowmobilers paradise. But it’s also a very popular spot for skiers, snowshoers and sledders. It’s the job of the U-S forest service to make sure everyone here gets along.                 ((sot @ 21:30 Larry Anderson, US Forest Service))        “We have about four square miles where snowmobiles can operate…”        ((sot @ 21:43))        “…and, the forest service policy is to manage for multi use. And this is one of the areas we’ve delegated for that use. Both snowmobilers, cross country skiers, motorized and non-motorized use.”                ((track 2)) That four square mile boundary is clearly marked with signs, and the forest service regularly patrols the area. They also have a crew of volunteers who come out here for fun…and help educate the public at the same time.                ((sot @ 22:23))        “They’re our eyes and ears for this area. They understand the rules. They’ve been trained on the usfs policies and they extend that to the visitors out here.”                ((track 3)) The volunteers do it because they love the sport. And they realize a few bad apples can spoil the fun for everyone.                ((sot snowmobiling #2 tape @ 2:16 Wayne Fisher, North Tahoe Snow Travelers))        “We feel we have a right to ride in national forests and public lands, but at the same time we have that right to ride we want to be responsible citizens in proving that we are doing the right thing and are courteous.”                ((track 4)) And the program seems to be working.                 ((nats – exhaust pipe))                ((Track 5)) The other concern with snowmobiles in the Tahoe basin is about what harm the powerful machines might be doing to the environment. Most snowmobiles these days have two-stroke engines…which are notorious for giving off high levels of emissions. The good news is the government is requiring manufacturers to clean up their machines…and make them quieter at the same time. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                Anchor Tag: U. S Forest Service rangers patrol the Tahoe Meadows area about four days a week. The remaining days are patrolled by volunteers.</description>

    <description>Segment 52: “Wildlife in Winter”                Anchor Intro: When the temperatures dip below freezing and the snow is piling up in the mountains, it’s nice to be able to go home to a warm home that protects you from the elements. But what do the animals do in the wintertime? Shelly Purdy takes a look in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take Pkg))                ((Track 1)) The sun may be shining now and the snow glistening…painting a pretty picture during the daytime. But, when night falls the temperatures drop and it’s miserably cold out here. Wintertime is particularly stressful on wildlife. Not only due to the cold but also the lack of available food. That’s why each species has adapted strategies to survive the season.                 ((s/u @ 17:23 Shelly Purdy))        “When it gets cold outside we tend to put on some extra layers of clothing, zip our coats a little higher. But there’s actually a species of weasel here in the Tahoe Basin that when it gets cold in the winter its coat changes color and helps it stay warm.”                ((sot @10:57 Shawn Espinosa, Nevada Division of Wildlife))        “Short tailed and long tailed weasels which we have in the basin …their coats will turn white in the wintertime except for the tip of their tail which wil be black.”                ((sot @ 11:34))        “Those white hairs lack pigment. Melanin is a pigment and it takes up space in the hairs. That space is now taken up by simply air. So, that coat has more insulation capability.”                ((Track 2)) With that extra insulation, the weasels are able to tough it out over the winter. Other animals like deer, migrate to lower elevations when snow covers the mountains. Birds like osprey and bald eagles are lucky…Lake Tahoe doesn’t freeze over in the winter…so they can keep on fishing throughout the year. There are also animals you’ve probably never seen before…like the flying squirrel that lives in the treetops and hunts for food at night. It’s a tough existence and many don’t make it through the winter. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                Anchor Tag: Other animals like bears and marmots hunker-down in burrows or dens to sleep-off the wintertime cold. But that sleep can sometimes be disturbed by people snowmobiling, cross country skiing or snowshoeing out in the backcountry. So if you plan to venture out into the forest this winter, be aware of the wildlife around you.</description>

    <description>Segment 53: “Pine Marten Study”        Air Date: February 3, 2004                Anchor Intro: You’ve probably never heard of a Pine Marten. It’s a small creature that lives in the forests around Lake Tahoe. But since the pine marten usually only comes out at night, scientists use specialized techniques to study the animal. Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take Pkg))                ((Track 1)) Scott McMorrow spends a lot of time trudging out in the snow to set up his remote sensor cameras. These cameras are motion and heat activated. And, they’re designed to take pictures of the critters living in the forest.                ((sot @ 13:56 Scott McMorrow, California State Parks))        “You need to get the animals here. Usually you use something nice and juicy like strawberry jelly and chicken works really well. Gets a lot of different animals to the bait.                ((track 2)) Animals like raccoons, bears, rabbits, dogs and even people every once in a while are all attracted to the camera. But Scott is really only interested in the Pine Marten.                ((Sot @ 14:44))        “Pine Marten is my goal because it’s an upper level forest carnivore if you will. Higher level on the food chain, and it represents the health of the forest ecosystem here.”                ((track 3)) It’s a tough job setting up and keeping track of so many remote sensor cameras. So Scott enlisted the help of a local fifth grade class. The class helped set up a camera by their school, and kept track of the animals that came to visit.                ((sot @ 4:51 Nicole Younger))        “After we had the pictures back we put together a poster to show what we learned about the project.”                 ((sot @ :34 Allyssa Hilker))        “Pine martens, if we have them in our forests our forests can provide the food for them and our forests are healthy.”                ((track 4)) It’s a way for these students to do some hands-on learning, and a way for Scott to get help with his research.                ((sot @ 16:13))        “Wildlife is very interesting to most people especially to kids and it’s nice to show them look at the wildlife that’s right outside your back door.”                ((track 5)) With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.”                Anchor Tag: By the way, the remote camera research can only be done in the wintertime because most bears are hibernating during the winter. When bears get a hold of the camera system, they usually destroy the camera.</description>

    <description>Segment 54: “Cross Country Skiing”        Air Date: February 10, 2004                Anchor Intro: When most people think of wintertime recreation, they think of downhill skiing. But as Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, cross country skiing is becoming a popular alternative to fighting the crowds at the big ski resorts.                ((Take Pkg))                ((Nats – guys skiing by))        ((Track 1)) The one thing you notice right away here at Spooner Lake Cross Country is the quiet. There are no crowds of people, no lifts, no snowmaking machines…and no traffic jams.                 ((Sot @ 12:40 Max Jones, Spooner Lake Cross Country))        “…It’s a really quiet, peaceful way to get out and enjoy the winter.”                ((track 2)) And contrary to popular belief about cross country skiing, it isn’t as tough as most people think. Admittedly there are no ski lifts to haul you up the hill, but you’re able to move at your own pace.                ((sot @ 10:12))        “People think that XC skiing is like too hard. They picture it trudging through a meadow in hip deep snow and we groom the trails just like downhill ski areas and you can treat it like between running and walking. Just because you’re on your feet doesn’t mean you have to be going hard.”                ((track 3)) And there are plenty of trails to choose from. Spooner Lake Cross Country has 50 miles of groomed trails ranging in difficulty from beginner to expert. The terrain takes visitors out into one of Nevada’s prettiest state parks. And though Spooner Lake Cross Country is run by a private company, they operate through a lease with the state park system. With limited state budgets, it’s a win win situation for everyone. The cross country center gives visitors a way to access the state park system during the wintertime. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.

    <description>Segment 55 	        Air Date: Feb. 17, 2004                        Anchor Intro: It has been one year since we first began the Lake Tahoe Report here on KOLO News Channel 8. Tonight, Shelly Purdy takes a look back at what we’ve shown you over the past year and takes a look forward at what we’ve got planned in the future.                        ((Take PGK))                ((Track 1)) By now you probably know the situation with Lake Tahoe. The famed clear blue water is losing clarity at a rate of about one foot per year. There are a wide variety of reasons for the loss in clarity. Dozens of research and restoration projects are underway at Lake Tahoe all with the same goal in mind: to protect the lake and restore its water quality.                In the past year we’ve shown you erosion control projects, wetlands restoration programs, roadway drainage systems, fire management policies, wildlife research and of course a myriad of water quality projects all underway at Lake Tahoe. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent. And, the researchers, educators, volunteers and government workers here at Tahoe have dedicated their lives to the cause. You might wonder why all the fuss?? That’s not a tough question to answer. Tahoe on a crummy day is just as magnificent as it is on a beautiful day. And whether you live here or just visit here, the health and quality if this lake affects us all.                ((S/U Shelly Purdy)) “We hope you’ve enjoyed learning about Lake Tahoe over the past year. And, we want to know what you think about the Lake Tahoe Report. Visit our website at kolotv.com to make comments, ask questions, or suggest future story ideas. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m shelly Purdy for KOLO News channel 8.”                ((Anchor Tag)) We invite you to take a moment to answer a few questions about the Lake Tahoe Report on this week’s web survey. That’s at kolotv.com.</description>

    <description>Segment 56 “Great Basin Outdoor School”	Air Date: February 24, 2004                Anchor Intro: Lake Tahoe may be only a short drive up the hill, but there are many kids who live here in the Reno area who never get the chance to visit the Tahoe area and spend time at the lake, in the forests and on the mountains. That’s where the non-profit organization – the Great Basin Outdoor School – comes into play. Shelly Purdy has details in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take Pkg))                ((Track 1)) The Great Basin Outdoor School just finished-up their winter sessions here at Camp Gallilee on the east shore of Lake Tahoe. Throughout the year, the school brings 5th and 6th graders to spend a few nights along the shores of Lake Tahoe and learn about the environment around them.                ((sot @ 4:38 Bobby Hembry, 5th Grader))        “I learned where Orion’s belt was and how big Orion is in the stars and I also learned that Leo’s a lion and Canus minor and Canus major.”                ((Track 2)) they learn about the stars in the sky, the water in the lake, the snow on the ground and the trees in the forest. The kids also get to strap on snowshoes…many for the very first time.                ((sot @ 3:19))        “It was hard. It was hard to try and walk with them. It’s different than walking in your regular shoes.”                ((sot @ 6:43 Sean McClelland, 5th Grader))        “We went looking at the animal tracks in the snow and um all the animals and plants and stuff and different rock formations.”                ((track 3)) The goal of the Great Basin Outdoor School is to get kids excited about learning by taking them out of the classroom and allowing them to discover the world around them.                ((sot @ 13:38 Sue Jacox, Great Basin Outdoor School President))        “the theory about outdoor school is that kids are in an outdoor setting in a place long enough to make a connection because you have to learn with your heart as well as your head.”                ((track 4)) For these kids, that theory really seems to be working. With the Lake Tahoe environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News channel 8.                Anchor Tag: The programs offered by the Great Basin Outdoor School are available to fifth or sixth grade classes throughout Northern Nevada.

    <description>Segment 57 “Air Quality Monitoring Stations” 	Air Date: March 2, 2004                Anchor Intro: Researchers at Lake Tahoe have discovered that air quality actually plays a big role in the clarity of the water in Lake Tahoe. Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take Pkg))                (( Track 1)) On a day like this, it’s impossible to see anything in the air…except of course, the rain. Nevertheless, researchers monitor the air quality around Lake Tahoe throughout the day, every day. They measure the actual air quality and weather conditions.                ((sot @ 7:51 Jennifer Quashnick, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))        “The weather has a huge impact on how air quality is effected by sources. One example is in the wintertime, carbon monoxide form cars builds up because we have these inversions that trap, things on the surface and that’s why we see our highest carbon monoxide in the wintertime.”                ((track 2)) That’s why on clear blue days during the wintertime, there’s often a brown haze blanketing the Tahoe Basin. It’s the smoke and  dust trapped in the air. In the summertime, additional pollution from ozone and particles from smoke and dust can often be seen as a regional haze throughout the Basin”.….   [Note:  Carbon Monoxide is colorless – what you see mostly in winter is smoke and dust; in the summer- ozone and particulate matter are visible pollutants, just not as obvious to see because the inversions break up in the morning]                ((sot @ 12:14))        “Ozone is generated when you have sunlight mixed with certain pollutants in the air.   So as the sun comes up in the morning, ozone levels generally begin to increase. They’ll peak mid-day then decrease as the sun goes down.”                ((Track 3)) But here in the Tahoe basin, ozone levels have been recorded to peak late at night. The cause… pollution floating in from Sacramento and the Bay Area. It’s a concern regulators are taking very seriously as they make plans for the future. Because much of that pollution falls from the sky over Lake Tahoe and drops in the water…contributing to the clarity problem. Air quality not only impacts us in the air we breathe, it also effects the health of the lake and the forest. With the Lake Tahoe environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News channel 8.                Anchor Tag: One way to do your part to reduce air pollution is to take fewer trips in your car, use public transportation, try to ride share or car pool to work, and finally, educate yourself about Tahoe’s environmental issues and pay attention when it’s time to head to the polls.</description>

    <description>Segment 58 “Transportation”		Air Date: March 9, 2004                                Anchor Intro: We all hate it…and we all have to live with it. Traffic is something that’s a part of everyone’s life these days. At Lake Tahoe, regulators are working to figure out ways to reduce traffic and make it run more smoothly. Shelly Purdy has details in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                                ((Take Pkg))                                ((Track 1)) When traffic is moving, most of us are happy to just go along on our way and not think about it very much. But when traffic is slow or stopped, that’s when we all complain. Traffic is one of those issues that everyone can relate to. But rarely do people get involved with the process of transportation planning.                                 ((sot @ 21:29 Jennifer Quashnick, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))                “We definitely want that input from both residents and visitors - we want people to get involved.”                                ((Track 2)) There are a wide variety of traffic planning programs and studies underway at Lake Tahoe. Recently, TRPA staff members hit the streets asking motorists a series of questions. Where did they drive from? If they’re visiting, are they taking public transportation while they’re here? The results of this and other surveys will be used to help plan traffic improvements in the future. So, why go to all the trouble? Because traffic has a direct connection to air quality.                                ((sot @ 18:54))                “Transportation is one the biggest sources of air pollution, and air pollution also contributes to lake clarity.”                                ((Track 3)) The obvious ways to do your part to help reduce traffic and air pollution are to drive less, use public transportation and walk or rid your bike to where you want to go. Also, educate yourself on Tahoe’s environmental issues and become involved with the planning process.  With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                                Anchor Tag: Another way regulators are trying to limit the amount of traffic on the streets at Tahoe is by requiring large businesses to participate in employer trip reduction programs. Business owners can offer incentives to their employees such as organizing carpool groups and giving employees passes for public transportation.</description>

    <description>Segment 59 “Fire Safe Council”	Air Date: March 16, 2004                Anchor Intro: With snow on the ground, it may not seem like the appropriate time to be thinking about fire season. But, this time of year, fire managers are actually very busy making plans for the upcoming season. Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take Pkg))                ((Nats – rain!!))                ((Track 1)) On a day like this the last thing on your mind is fire danger. Fire managers are using this down time to make plans for the upcoming summer fire season. At Lake Tahoe, those plans are critical if they want to avoid a catastrophe like the one we saw this fall in southern California, where thousands of acres burned, hundred of homes were destroyed and lives were lost. Come spring, workers will set out on a myriad of fuel reduction programs, cutting trees, piling slash and burning unwanted forest debris.                 ((sot @ 18:48 Elwood Miller, Nevada Fire Safe Council))        “The only thing we can really do sometimes is about the fuel We can’t do anything about the slope, We can’t do anything about aspect, but we can do something about the fuel.”                ((track 2)) And at Tahoe, the “fuel” includes the many homes scattered throughout the forest. Homes with wood shake roofs burn just like trees do. It was a hard lesson learned in southern California last year. And one that insurance companies like State Farm are taking note of.                ((sot @ 20:35)) “They’re going to the individual owner’s property and point out to them things they can do, activities they can engage in that will reduce that risk.:”                ((track 3)) Like replacing wood shingles with more fire-resistant materials. Homeowners who fail to make the required changes could have their insurance policies cancelled. It’s a drastic step, but one many believe is necessary to head-off a catastrophic wildfire.                ((sot @ 23:41))        “the environmental consequences would be horrendous. And we often think only of the fire itself and what the fire does. But it’s just as important to think about the aftermath of the fire.”                ((Track 4)) All you have to do is look at what’s happening in southern California now to see just how bad it could be at Lake Tahoe. Massive mudslides, out of control erosion, and possibly even more loss of life.  It’s a very real very scary possibility. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                Anchor Tag: Researchers believe that if there were a major fire at Lake Tahoe it could set the quality and clarity of the lake back 100 years.                ADD: Future programs will talk about the fire prevention efforts currently underway.</description>

    <description>Segment 60 - Contractors' Workshop	Air Date: March 23, 2004                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Anchor Intro: Contractors, engineers, architects and landscapers looking to increase their client base are invited to attend the fifth annual best management practices workshop at Lake Tahoe. Shelly Purdy has details in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((Take PKG))                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((Nats - construction))                                                                                                                                ((Track 1)) Construction is a huge industry at Lake Tahoe, and whether you’re building a new home or enjoying life in an already built house - every property owner in the Tahoe Basin is required to install BMPs or best management practices on their land.  BMPs include things like planting native shrubs, installing catch basins or drains for runoff water and paving driveways all in an effort to control erosion. But many homeowners don’t want to or are unable to do that type of work themselves, and want to hire landscapers or contractors to do it for them. That’s where the BMP workshop comes in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((sot @ 7:57 Molly Pulsifer, Tahoe Resources Conservation District))                                                                                                                                “The workshop is meant to teach people about BMPs and designing and implementing landscapes that are beautiful and functional and environmentally friendly.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((track 2)) The workshop will be held April 1st at the Lake Tahoe Community College in South Lake Tahoe. Participants will spend the morning inside learning about the nuts and bolts of Best Management Practices, then go outside for hands-on learning at the college’s demonstration garden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((sot @ 1:08 John Crus, Ecologic Design, Inc.))                                                                                                                                “They’re using best technology and the best technology change over time. A contractor who was versed in these ten years ago may not be versed in them today.”                                                                                                                                	                                                                                                                                ((Track 3)) Aside from the information participants will learn at the workshop, everyone who attends will also be put on a resource list that is distributed to area property owners looking for help with their BMP work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((sot @ 10:57))                                                                                                                                “What our agencies do is we do site evaluations for homeowners to tell them what BMPs if any they need. So we’ll go out and conduct a site evaluation and from there we give the homeowner a resource list and they have a list of professionals they can call to implement the BMPs once they’ve been recommended.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((Track 4)) And by using a contractor or landscaper who is trained to use the best and latest technology, property owners are ensuring that their BMP work gets done correctly. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((Anchor Tag)) For more information on the BMP workshop or to sign up, visit our website at kolotv.com. Though participants who take the class will receive a certificate of completion, there is no BMP certification. Homeowners who hire contractors or landscapers to do BMP work are encouraged to have their project inspected by an outside agency throughout the construction process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </description>

    <description>Segment 61 - New Day at TRPA	Air Date: March 30, 2004                        ((Ancor Intro)) There are two new people in key positions at the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. And they say change is coming. Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take PKG))                ((Track 1)) The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency has been regulating growth and development at Lake Tahoe for more than 30 years. The agency has long struggled with a negative public image despite the positive work that has been accomplished on behalf of Lake Tahoe.                ((sot @ 4:58 John Singlaub, TRPA Executive Director))        “There’s a reason that we’re still beautiful up here and the reason’s because we have these regulations...the focus becomes for some reason on the development part of things and until we can overcome the challenges: the delays, the fairness, are we treating people consistently when they come in, those issues very loudly people in the basin are saying are their concerns.”                ((sot @ 28:23 Julie Regan, TRPA Communications Director))        “It’s a new day at TRPA. We have a lot of work to do. We have a history at TRPA certainly. Tahoe has a lot of history, a lot of controversy and we’re at an exciting time in the agency’s history.                ((track 2)) Exciting because measurable progress is being made. Millions of dollars are being spent on environmental improvement projects throughout the Tahoe Basin. Scientists are learning more about the lake and specific steps they can take to keep the water clean and clear. And it’s the job of the TRPA to make sure that happens.                ((sot @ 30:15 Julie))        “Because at the end of the day that’s what makes us feel good. That we are working to save Lake Tahoe. But you can’t do that in a vacuum. The people that live here and the people that support us outside the basin are so important to that process. And keeping them in the loop, informed and getting their ideas about how to move ahead is so critical.”                ((sot @ 7:39 John))        “the good news is the employees don’t want to work for an agency that’s hated. They don’t have any desire to be in that position and they’re all open and ready for change.”                ((track 3)) Positive change that will benefit not only how the TRPA operates,but the lake itself. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                ((Anchor Tag)) New Executive Director John Singlaub asks that the public be patient with the TRPA. He says the problems it took 30-some years to create won’t be changed overnight...but he’s working on it.</description>

    <description>Segment 62  - Lake Tahoe MOS	Air Date: April 6, 2004                                                ((Anchor Intro))                We’ve been airing the Lake Tahoe Report for just over a year now here on KOLO News Channel 8. And, we’ve interviewed most of the movers and shakers at Tahoe...researchers, educators, policy makers, legislators and more. Tonight, Shelly Purdy takes a look at what the average person on the street thinks about the lake and the efforts to save it.                                ((Take PKG))                                ((Track 1)) A beautiful sunny day brings out the best in Lake Tahoe. And it also brings out the people...drawn to the lake’s shore to enjoy it’s glowing beauty.                                 ((sot @ 8:28 April Dodd, Jacksonville, FL))                “It’s beautiful. Very nice, uh, lovely. It’s clean. The lake, I can’t believe how blue it is. It’s just very pretty.”                                ((Track 2)) It’s very simple. People love this lake. But the question is, how do we keep from loving it to too much?                                ((sot @ 12:01 Mirian Chiaramonte, San Jose, CA))                “People all want to come up here and live up here, but they have water and electricity and everything else that has to be done. Trees have to be taken down son and so forth. So you need to be careful and controlling it is important.”                                ((sot @ 9:27))                “This is beautiful. This is a wonderful gift that God’s given this part of the country. And, you know, everything needs to be done to keep it clean and pure.”                                ((nats - sledders))                                ((Track 3)) And for some, Tahoe is more than just a great place to live or visit. It’s an almost spiritual connection they share with the lake.

    <description>Lake Tahoe Report Segment #63 - &quot;Pathway 2007&quot;  (Air Date: April 20, 2004).  Segment discusses how the various Tahoe region agencies are working together to write a consistent regional plan that can be used to update other individual agency plans such as the Forest Service’s Land Management Plan and California and Nevada’s water quality plans. Includes an interview with Lauri Kemper from the Lahontan Regional Water quality Control Board) about the importance of public input into this planning process, which will be finalized in 2007.</description>

    <description>Segment 63 - Pathway 2007	Air Date: April 13                        ((Anchor Intro)) The agencies at Lake Tahoe that manage the waterways, forests and ecosystems of the Tahoe Basin are now in the process of updating the area’s regional plan. And, your input is needed. Shelly Purdy has details of how you can get involved in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take PKG))                ((Track 1)) Regional plans aren’t really a riveting topic of discussion. But at Lake Tahoe, the regional plan that’s being written right now will determine the future of the lake for the next 20 years. For the first time, the various agencies at Tahoe are working together to write a,  consistent regional plan that can be used to update other individual agency plans such as the Forest Service’s Land Management Plan and California and Nevada’s water quality plans.                ((sot @ 22:28 Lauri Kemper, Lahontan Regional Water quality Control Board))        “And, we want to hear from the public about what their concerns are about the lake’s water quality and what their future vision is for the lake ecosystem.”                ((track 2)) There will be many opportunities for public participation between now and when the regional plan is finalized in 2007...beginning with a symposium this May where researchers will share the very latest scientific data about the lake.                ((sot @ 23:28))        “We’ll have the opportunity for the first time to really know what are the sources of pollution going into Lake Tahoe and in what quantities. And we’ll also know how much we need to reduce the pollutant loads by.”                ((sot @ 23:40))        “With that information the public will be able to help us figure out what are some of the best methods to reduce that pollutant load and what are the contributions and reductions they’re willing to make.”                ((track 3)) So if you’re interested in being a part of Lake Tahoe’s future, now is your chance to get involved. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’;m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                ((Anchor tag)) We will keep you up to date on all upcoming times and dates of regional plan public meetings.</description>

    <description>Segment 64 – Impacts of Dogs &amp; Geese                Air Date: April 27, 2004                                Anchor Intro: In an effort to head off contamination and the loss of transparency (or clarity)[RE2] in Lake Tahoe, ever since the 1970s all the raw and treated sewage generated locally has been pumped [RE3]away for disposal outside of the Lake Tahoe Basin. But there are other sources of  waste products that could be making their  way into Tahoe’s blue waters, and you’ll be surprised at where they are coming from. Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                                ((Take PKG))                                ((Track 1)) Dogs may be man’s best friend, but, unless we clean up their mess, they could prove to be  unfriendly [RE4]to the health of Lake Tahoe. Water officials estimate there are approximately 15-thousand dogs in the Tahoe Basin. That equates to a lot of waste that could potentially make its way into the lake.                                ((sot @ 25:18 Robert Erlich, Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board))                “If all of that material is deposited and none of that would get picked-up we could view that having an impact of nutrient load equivalent to if you maybe had 5,000 people in the Tahoe Basin not on a sewer system.”                                ((track 2)) That could equate[RE5] to as much as about 80 tons of nitrogen and 15 tons phosphorus added to soils and streets in the Lake Tahoe Basin each year just coming from dog waste. And that’s not the only problem.                                ((s/u John Pang tape #@ 14:18 Shelly Purdy))                “Geese have also become a big problem at Lake Tahoe because Tahoe has the two things geese like the most…grassy vegetation and water.”                                ((sot dog tape @ 28:18))                “To the extent that geese are grazing on lawns that are fertilized with fertilizer people brought in then we have some responsibility for increasing the goose population.”                                ((track 3)) The geese are drawn to the beautiful green grass lawns found at homes and businesses throughout the Tahoe Basin. They eat the grass which is now kept green much of the year by fertilizers and irrigation[RE6]…then deposit their droppings on the ground. Since geese generally stay in the wet areas or on the lake shore, much of  that material eventually makes its way to the lake. Though talking about the impacts of dog and goose poop on lake clarity may sound a bit ridiculous it has become a serious issue at Tahoe. The dog and goose populations have soared here and the mess they leave behind is just getting bigger. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                                ((Anchor tag)) You can do your part to help the situation by simply picking up after your dog. It doesn’t take much effort yet it makes a big difference.                 [RE1]Pumping either treated or untreated effluent long distances still has risks of spills.                [RE2]Or you could say “and the growth of algae”                [RE3]Not all is pumped over the mountains. From Kings Beach to Tahoma, raw sewage is pumped out of the Tahoe Basin on a route near the Truckee River for treatment at Tahoe-Truckee Sanitation Agency facilities near Truckee. South Tahoe Public Utility District is the largest sewage agency; they pump treated sewage from South Lake Tahoe over Luther Pass for disposal in grazing lands in Alpine County.                [RE4]Language is too strong; I’m not aware of studies that have looked at how much dog waste reaches Lake Tahoe, and don’t want to overstate the impact.                 [RE5]Please don’t suggest that all the estimated 80 tons of nitrogen and 15 tons of phosphorus in waste from dogs could reach the lake.  Some gets picked up, much is absorbed into soils; we don’t want to suggest that those numbers reach the lake.  Rather than thinking about dog waste as a direct nutrient load to the lake, it is more like application of fertilizer or dumping dog food on the ground  in the areas where people live in the Tahoe Basin. The fertilizer, dog food, or dog wastes contains a lot of nutrients that we are importing into Tahoe, but it’s not like we are dumping it directly into the lake. Dog waste is a nuisance and a problem, but most of the nutrient load would not be expected to reach the lake.                [RE6]Yuk!  Don’t know if the geese eat “grass which is covered by chemical fertilizers”</description>

    <description>Segment 65 – Building Season Begins                                Air Date: May 4, 2004                                                                Anchor Intro: With our early spring weather this year, construction season here in the Reno area has been underway for weeks now. But at Lake Tahoe the official start of construction season began on May first. Shelly Purdy has more in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                                                                ((Take Pkg))                                                                ((Track 1)) The official construction or “grading” season at Lake Tahoe is May first through October 15th…weather permitting. Thought it may seem strange to have a set season for construction there is a valid reason for it.                                                                ((sot @ 17:11 Carl Hasty, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))                                “The reason that’s important at Lake Tahoe is because the weather is inclement from October 15th through May 1st. And so it’s really tough to make sure that soil’s not eroding and that’s why there’s a limitation on grading.                                                                 ((Track 2)) So now that the first of May has come and gone all the dirt work can begin.                                                                 ((natpop – yard work))                                                                ((Track 3)) Now is also the time to start working in the yard…if you haven’t done it already. In the Tahoe basin, it’s also time to begin working on your BMPs or Best Management Practices.                                                                ((s/u @ 2:06 Shelly Purdy))                                “Thousands of residents here in the Tahoe Basin will soon be getting a card in the mail that explains the BMP process and includes a mail in card for a free property inspection.”                                                                ((sot @ 5:00 Brendan Ferry, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))                                “There are certain deadlines. We’ve divided the lake into 3 priority areas and there are still thousands of peoperty owners out there required to do BMPs to meet the local ordinance and do erosion control on their property to help protect Lake Tahoe.”                                                                ((sot @ 18:32 Carl Hasty))                                “Everyone has a piece to do. Everyone has a part ot Play in solving the water quality problems and the clarity issues at Lake Tahoe. And one of those is for the individual property owner. So the idea is if we all take care of our individual watershed, then we’re not contributing to the larger problem.”                                                                ((Track 4)) With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO news Channel 8.

    <description>Segment 66 “Tahoe Research Symposium”                Air date: May 11, 2004                                Anchor Intro: Hundreds of millions of your tax dollars are being spent at Lake Tahoe each year on research and environmental improvement projects. But how do you or the people doing the research know if that money is being spent wisely? Shelly Purdy takes a look in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                                ((Take Pkg))                                ((Track 1)) President Clinton asked for it during the Tahoe Forum…a place where scientists and researchers could work together and share information, collaborate on ideas and hopefully save time and money in the effort to preserve lake Tahoe. That meeting will take place in (next weeks?) second biannual research symposium at the Cal Neva. Researchers, educators, policy makers, and interested members of the public will gather to discuss the most recent data and scientific information about Lake Tahoe. Without this kind of symposium…                                ((sot @ 11:40 Tim Rowe, Hydrologist))                “There’d be a lot of duplication of efforts from things not being done that should be done, working collaboratively and wasting money and getting everybody on the same page and working together and doing a lot more for less money.”                                ((Track 2)) There will be 55 presentations, 45 posters and 4 field trips designed to give participants a look at the very latest scientific research being done here. Everything from water quality, fire monitoring, revegetation efforts, forest health and wildlife populations will be discussed.                                 ((sot @ 14:14 Carl Hasty, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))                “The more informed we are with solid information the better decisions can be made whether it’s a manager on the land or a policy maker on the board or an executive such as myself and that’s what we’re really after.”                                ((Track 3)) The information learned at the symposium will then be used to help develop community and regional plans for the Lake Tahoe Basin.

    <description>Segment 67: Snapshot Day                Air Date: May 18, 2004                                Tease @ 21:59 “It’s your opportunity to do some hands-on research at Lake Taeho. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll tell you how to get involved in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.”                                Anchor Intro: Scientists at Lake Tahoe and here in the Reno area are looking for the public’s help in an upcoming research effort called Snapshot Day. Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                                ((Take Pkg))                                ((Track 1)) Only 15 out of the 63 streams and rivers that feed into Lake Tahoe are monitored on a regular basis. Researchers would like to do more monitoring, but simply do not have the resources. That’s why every year they ask volunteers to participate in Snapshot Day.                                 ((sot @ 7:50 Jason Kuchnicki, Environmental Scientist, Nevada Division of Environmental Protection))                “The agencies are looking toward citizen monitoring as being a viable tool for providing information at a low cost.”                                ((track 2)) On Snapshot day volunteers will be sent to sites along Tahoe’s tributaries. The sites have been mapped by GPS and flagged. The volunteers will assess the overall look of the stream, take a temperature reading, test for pH and dissolved oxygen.                                ((sot@ 12:25 Melissa Blake, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))                “So we measure all of these parameters so we can see how healthy the streams are and if there are hot spots or if something’s not quite right we can send researchers out to monitor that and if there’s a pollution source we can then mitigate that source.”                                ((s/u @ 21:20 Shelly Purdy)) “For the first time this year, some of the data collected in Snapshot Day is going to be used by researchers for what’s called the TMDL or Tahoe Maximum Daily Load.”                                ((sot @ 6:03))                “What they try to do on a daily basis is figure out how much load of pollutants the water body can take in this case Lake Tahoe and still meet that water quality standard.”                                ((Track 3)) That’s why the volunteers are so critical to this effort. Without them, it would be nearly impossible for the agencies up here - working with limited resources- to collect the data they need. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                                                Anchor Tag: Snapshot Day is May 22nd. Volunteers will be sent to various locations at Lake Tahoe and along the Truckee River. If you would like to volunteer visit our website at kolotv.com for more information.</description>

    <description>Segment 68 “Community Fire Planning”                Air Date: May 25, 2004                                Anchor Intro: The newly passed Healthy Forest Restoration Act is giving fire districts across the country the opportunity to tap-into funding for wildfire prevention projects…and the various fire districts at Lake Tahoe are looking to get their share of that money.                                ((track 1)) It’s scenes like this that every fire manager in the Tahoe basin, and around the country for that matter, wants to avoid. And with money now available under the Healthy Forest Recreation Act, fire managers in the Tahoe Basin are eager to get funding for much needed fire prevention projects. But before they submit their funding requests, fire managers must put together a community fire plan…put together with the help of the local community.                                ((sot @ 5:22 Chief John Pang, Meeks Bay Fire Protection District))                “We’d like to get them and ask them their opinions. Explain what’s going on. Explain the healthy forest act. Explain the need for a fire safe basin, prevent erosion in the basin, keep Tahoe blue.”                                ((sot @ 22:05 Carl Hasty, Executive Director Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))                “That’s the key there. Congress has said we’ll authorize it, but they haven’t put the money there yet. So the community plans are a way to say this is what our actions would be. These are our priority areas, these are our highest risk areas, this is what it’s going to cost.”                                ((track 2)) The development of these fire plans signifies a bit of a change in attitude within the Tahoe basin.                                  ((sot @ 3:27))                 “In the past we’ve gone out and told people hey you need to create your defensible space and the biggest concern we’ve had from folks is TRPA won’t let us do that. TRPA is now encouraging it.”                                ((track 3)) The local fire districts are now working together with the TRPA to mark trees that should be cut to create defensible space. It means big changes in the look of the thick dense forests we’re used to seeing in the Tahoe basin.                                ((sot @ 4:14))                “We’d like to encourage that it’s probably better to see more of your neighbor’s house and more of an open forest than one full of brown trees or choked or in the worst case scenario…charred foundations.”                                ((track 4)) With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for kolo news channel 8.                                Anchor Tag: The local fire districts around the Tahoe Basin will soon be announcing dates, times and locations for public workshops. They encourage anyone who is interested in community fire planning to participate.</description>

    <description>Segment 69: Community Watershed Planning                Air Date: June 1, 2004                                Tease: @ 20:24 “When it comes to protecting Lake Tahoe it all starts at the top of the watershed. I’m Shelly Purdy, in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report I’ll take you to a beautiful home where they’re doing their part to protect the lake.”                                Anchor Intro: All homeowners at Lake Tahoe are required to install BMP’s or “Best Management Practices” on their property to help control erosion. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy shows us a way property owners can save money while puttng in their BMP’s.                                ((track 1)) It seems like this home sits on top of the world…high up on the mountain with breathtaking views of Lake Tahoe. The reality is…this home is at top…the top of a watershed that drains into the lake. That’s why when Bill Watson bought this house, he wanted to do the right thing: put in some landscaping with the best management practices in mind.                                ((sot @ 16:18 Bill Watson, Homeowner))                “What we did was we backed up the hillside and followed the natural contour and allowed tha water that flows off the lawn to drain onto this table which in turn has a drainage system that puts the water into a dry well and controls the runoff.”                                ((track 2)) He also reduced the amount of sod on the property, stabilized the eroding hillside and installed water infiltration systems around the house to control runoff. Bill is lucky – he has the financial resources to take on such a big job. But, for the average homeowner in the Tahoe Basin, cost can be an issue.                                ((s/u @ 18:32 Shelly Purdy))                “The reality of BMPs is not only are they required by local ordinance, but they also are intended to help preserve Lake Tahoe. That’s why when neighbor’s work together so much more can be accomplished.”                                ((sot @ 2:44 Todd Gillihan, Nevada Tahoe Conservation District))                “It allows us to work with the contractor and the homeowner and try to get a group of people together where a contractor can come and give a bid on four to five homes at a time. And he can mobilize once when the contractor comes out to do the labor and he can buy the materials in bulk which is one of the biggest cost savings.”                                ((track 3)) Todd Gillihan from the Nevada Tahoe Conservation District specializes in helping people with BMP’s.  He provides free evaluations and technical assistance to property owners. He’s always looking for ways to get homeowners to work together on BMP projects, because not only does it save money but also helps control erosion and runoff from getting into the lake. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education, I’m Shelly Purdy for kolo news channel 8.

    <description>Segment 70: Tahoe Environmental Research Center        Air Date: June 8, 2004                Anchor Intro: Hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent at Lake Tahoe on scientific research. And it seems everyone wants a piece of the action. In an effort to save money and duplication of efforts, a new research facility will soon be built that will house scientists from several different organizations. Shelly Purdy has details in tonight’s Lake Tahoe report.                ((TAKE PKG))                ((Track 1)) The conditions at UC Davis’ current research center are shocking. The old fish hatchery is nearly falling apart, and the scientists do their state of the art research under near third world conditions. UC Davis has been trying to build a new facility for years. Well, it’s finally going to happen. Sierra Nevada College at Incline Village has asked UC Davis to collaborate on a new research facility. The Desert Research Institute has also jumped into the mix, and they will break ground on the facility in May of 2005.                ((sot @ 2:41 Joann Hankin, Vice President, Sierra Nevada College))        “This is an incredible partnership between the private and public sectors of education, between two states, between multiple institutions.”                ((Track 2)) The three story building will hold a public area and exhibit space on the first floor. Classrooms and laboratories for Sierra Nevada students on the second floor, and research facilities for UC Davis scientists on the third floor.                ((sot @ 6:58 Benjamin Solomon, President, Sierra Nevada College))        “The main thing here is we’re going to have cutting edge scientists on the campus both from Davis and DRI and possibly from Rand. And these people will teach some of the classes here which will be open to our students.”                ((track 3)) Not only will the students benefit from the science being studied around them, they’ll also benefit from the building itself. Like many of the other structures on Sierra Nevada’s new lake campus, the new research center will be a “green” building that utilizes passive solar energy to provide most of the building’s own power, heat and hot water.                 ((sot @ 9:51))         “They’re not only a place to learn, but they’re a place to use as a demonstration project. Every time a student enters a classroom they should be reminded that they’re having very low impact on the environment by using these facilities.”                ((Track 4)) With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for kolo news channel 8.                Anchor Tag: the new building should be complete by late summer of 2006.</description>

    <description>Segment 71 Lahontan Cutthroat Trout        Air Date: June 15                Anchor Intro: Waterways from Lake Tahoe to Pryamid Lake once teemed with the native Lahontan Cutthroat Trout. But, by the early 1930s, the Lahontan Cutthroat was extinct in Lake Tahoe and barely hanging on in Pyramid Lake. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a look at efforts to reintroduce the fish to Tahoe.                ((TAKE PKG))                ((nats water in creek))                ((Track 1)) Here at Fallen Leaf Lake, there are Lahontan Cutthroat Trout in the water…but only because they’ve been put here. Scientists are using Fallen Leaf Lake as a test study for Tahoe.                ((Sot @ 2:33 Brant Allen, UC Davis Researcher))        “The fish have gone in and we are looking at how they survive in the lake and the reason we’re using Fallen Leaf lake is really it’s a smaller system that we can study and get ideas for other lakes in the Truckee Watershed. If we were to use Lake Tahoe, Tahoe is very vast and you could put a lot of fish in there and never find them.”                ((track 2)) Researchers are trying to figure out how the trout spawn, how quickly they grow and how they feed in the lake. But the most important thing they want to know is if the fish can survive here without being eaten by non-native fish. Because about the time the Lahontan Cutthroat became extinct in Tahoe and its tributaries, various non-native species of fish were introduced in an effort to boost the commercial fishery. When thousands of small Lanontan Cutthroats were stocked in Fallen Leaf Lake two summers ago…most of them were eaten by those other fish. But last summer, Fallen Leaf was stocked with larger Cutthroats…and so far they’ve done very well.                ((s/u @11:45 Shelly Purdy))        “A project like this certainly isn’t easy and it’s going to take researchers many many years to figure out if they can even do it.”                ((sot @5:22))        “Long term goal would be to have a recreational fishery in Fallen Leaf Lake based on native fish that is able to self sustain itself through spawning and natural stream settings and long term is maybe 20 years out.”                ((track 3)) If this project is successful, it means a native species will be back where it should be…thriving in it’s natural habitat. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for kolo news channel 8.                Anchor Tag: Those larger fish that Shelly mentioned were stocked in Fallen Leaf Lake last summer and are doing well…researchers expect that they should spawn for the first time next year.</description>

    <description>Segment 72: Pine Needles        Air Date: June 22, 2004                Tease @ 20:29 “This pile behind me is 2000 cubic yards of pine needles. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll tell you what it’s doing here in the Diamond Peak parking lot coming up tonight on the Lake Tahoe Report.”                Anchor Intro:        Did you know that pine trees drop around two to three inches of pine needles each year? Over time, the pine needles can really build up…creating a fire hazard during the summertime months. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a look at a very successful pine needle recycling program that’s helping residents reduce fire danger and helping contractors keep Tahoe blue.                ((Take PKG))                ((Track 1)) This is what 2000 cubic yards of pine needles looks like. The size of the pile stays about the same throughout the summer as residents dump their pine needles off and area contractors take truckloads away.                 ((sot @ 4:01 Sarah Tone, Incline Village General Improvement District))        “What happens is the residents will bring them by from 8-4:30 Monday through Friday and drop them off and we redistribute them to local contractors and they use them for erosion control projects.”                ((s/u @ 19:49 Shelly Purdy))        “What the pine needle program is really all about is eliminating the slopes like this behind me that are completely bare and prone to erosion.”                ((sot @ 7:04 Michael Hogan, Soil Scientist))        “For years, people have done erosion control with other things such as wood fiber, mulch or straw, but neither one of those last very long. So Pine needles last a longer. They also over time provide nutrients to the soil just like they do on the forest floor.”                ((Track 2)) Michael Hogan has come up with a technique to reduce erosion that mimics mother nature. He takes bare disturbed slopes like this and tills a mixture of mulch and natural seeds into the soil. Then the pine needles are sprayed on top. Without any irrigation…this is what you end up with a year or two later. The pine needles have trapped the moisture from snowmelt and helped the seeds germinate. It’s a method developed by simply copying what the forest does in it’s own natural setting.                 ((sot @ 7:33))        “That’s one of the things we’re trying to do with our work is figure out what nature has already figured out and use that to control erosion rather than borrow things from agriculture practices which turn out not to work very well.”                ((track 3)) With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                Anchor TAG: Though it’s important to remove excess pine needles from your yard to create defensible space for fire protection, the experts say you should never rake down to bare dirt. By leaving a small layer of duff on the ground, you’ll help to control erosion on your own property.</description>

    <description>Segment 73: Fire Risk Assessment (Satellite Mapping)        Air Date: June 29                Anchor Intro: Four fire districts on the California side of Lake Tahoe have pooled their resources to do some very high-tech fire risk assessments. Shelly Purdy explains how satellite mapping will help the districts plan for the future in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take PKG))                ((Track 1)) These pictures may look a little blurry and they’re all marked-up for a reason. They’ve been taken from miles above the earth by a satellite camera aimed at Lake Tahoe. The photos are being analyzed by Davey Resource Group. Forestry Technician Scott Wheaton uses these initial pictures to fine-tune the satellite’s computer. Wheaton checks the accuracy of the photos by verifying what the satellite sees. Once he identifies a blue spot like this on the photo as a metal roof instead of a small pond, he can tell the computer to do it. Adjustments are made, and the satellite pumps-out incredibly detailed and accurate photographic images.                 ((sot @ 9:44 Scott Wheaton, Davey Resource Group))        “Some of the things that we look at from the photos are roof types, types of vegetation around. The roof types we’re looking at metal roofs. You have metal here, asphalt shingle, cedar shake, just different types of roofs that I can identify from the photos.”                ((track 2)) He can also identify one-way roads like here at Rocky Ridge. He can measure the number of trees per acre, the fuel density, the amount of dead trees, and identify high risk areas.                ((sot @ 11:59))        “I’m finding a lot of cedar shake roofs. A lot of wood siding. Not a lot of defensible space. But hopefully with planning and things that we’re doing we’ll be able to come up with a plan that can fix some of that.”                ((track 3)) That’s the purpose of this entire project…to come up with a community fire plan as required by the newly passed Healthy Forest Restoration Act. Once this plan is complete, the local fire districts will be able to apply for grant money to pay for wildfire prevention projects.                ((sot @ 2:31 Division Chief Bryce Keller, North Tahoe Fire Protection District))        “This will give us the tool or the document to say this validates our gut feeling. What we know day in and day out that there’s a lot of work that needs to be done to protect the Tahoe Basin from a large catastrophic wildfire.”                ((track 4)) The plan will identify priority areas and projects that can compliment the work currently being done by the U.S. Forest Service and California State Parks throughout the Tahoe Basin. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                Anchor Tag: Public input is a big component of these Community Fire Plans. A series of public workshops is already underway at the various fire districts around Lake Tahoe. Everyone is encouraged to participate in the creation of their local Community Fire Plan.

    <description>Segment 74: Macroinvertibrates (aka: bugs)        Air Date: 7/6/04                Tease (TRAM tape 2 @ 2:31) “I’m Shelly Purdy here at Sagehen Creek. I’ll take you under the water into a bug’s life in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.”                Anchor Intro: One of the best ways to check the water quality of rivers and streams is NOT to chemically test the water. Instead, the best way to test the water is to look at the bugs that live in it. Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take PKG))                ((Natpop – water in Sagehen Creek)                ((track 1)) This is Sagehen Creek…a beautiful little stream just off highway 89 north of Truckee. It’s a quiet, peaceful area that’s a favorite of hikers and fishermen. From the looks of it, there’s not much going on at Sagehen Creek…but looks can be deceiving.                ((s/u TRAM tape 2 @ 2:07 Shelly Purdy)) “When you look at a stream like this from the surface it’s hard to imagine there’s an entire world living underneath.”                ((Track 2)) A world of bugs that come to life if you know how to look for them.                ((sot@ 10:19, Chris Rosamond Truckee River Aquatic Monitors Volunteer))        “What you do is you come in and scrub a certain surface area of the sub striate in the stream.”                ((track 3)) In other words…you scrub all the bugs off the rocks underwater and let them float into a net.                ((natpop @ 12:59)) “Get this sample and take a look at it…”                ((sot @ 25:20)) “We try to get as many different types of microhabitats as possible. We scrub different stones and gravel and weedbeds and so forth to try and find the maximum number of animals.”                ((track 4)) It’s important to get as many different types of bugs as possible to better gauge the health of the stream. The type of bugs you find tells you whether a water body is healthy or not.                ((sot @ 31:37  Beth Christman, Truckee River Watershed Council))        “Bugs are really one of the best ways of really pinpointing the impacts to a stream due to sediment.”                ((sot @27:40)) “You can look at that sediment as bad cholesterol. It’s sort of like this plaque that gets in there and totally changes the community because dissolved oxygen drops and you’ll start losing your good water quality bugs.”                ((track 5)) Here at Sagehen creek there’s mostly good bugs, and that means the water quality is relatively good. The Truckee River Aquatic Monitors will continue to test Sagehen and other area waterways to make sure it stays that way. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                Anchor Tag: The Truckee River Aquatic Monitors use volunteers to collect and identify bugs in the rivers and streams within the Truckee River Watershed. Their data is shared with state agencies and other researchers and used to identify future restoration projects.</description>

    <description>Segment 76: Green Boating        Air Date: July 20, 2004                Tease @13:33 “Green boating – it’s easier than you think. I’m Shelly Purdy and I’ll tell you how to do it tonight on the lake Tahoe report on KOLO News Channel 8.”                Anchor Intro: Summer is the perfect time to enjoy all that Lake Tahoe has to offer: waterskiing, paragliding, swimming and boating. But if you’re going to hop on your boat and head out on the lake, there are a few things to keep in mind to do your part to keep Tahoe blue. Shelly Purdy has details in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take Pkg))                ((Track 1)) Lake Tahoe carries the very special designation of an outstanding natural resource waterway. And, for good reason. It’s a beautiful lake. That’s part of what brings thousands of boaters here every year. But boats…due to the fact that they sit directly in the water…have the potential to pollute. There are a few easy things every boater can do to make sure they do their part to keep Tahoe blue.                ((sot @ 2:08 Brent Richmond, TRPA Watercraft Team))        “We encourage people to keep up on maintenance on their boats. Inspect the system to ensure there’s no leaks.”                ((track 2)) But even with the cleanest and most well maintained boat, there is always a little bit of oil that leaks from the engine. That’s why it’s a good idea to place bilge pads or pillows near the engine to take care of any leaking oil. It’s also a good idea to use the pads while you’re filling the gas tank.                ((sot @ 2:42))         “You place the bilge pillow over the nozzle to prevent any splash back that would get into the lake.”                ((s/u @ 12:39 Shelly Purdy))        “If there is a spill this material can be used on the surface of the water. It won’t absorb the water but it will pick up oil and gasoline.”                ((track 3)) It takes a little bit of extra effort, but it’s worth it. Lake Tahoe is a zero discharge lake. That means nothing can be dumped in this water…especially gray or black water. Most marinas have public dump stations for sewage and gray water so wait until you get there before pumping-out.                ((sot @ 6:09))        “Lake Tahoe again is a designated outstanding natural resource water. Direct discharge of any type is prohibited.”                        ((Track 4)) It’s not only beautiful, but it’s also the water we drink. Keeping it clean is in everyone’s best interest. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                Anchor Tag: If you move your boat from lake to lake it’s also a good idea to inspect your boat for weeds and other vegetation before launching into Lake Tahoe. Non-native weeds have become a problem at Lake Tahoe. A very common way weeds make their way from waterway to waterway is on boat propellers.</description>

    <description>Segment 77: Boating Rules        Air Date: July 27, 2004                Anchor intro: From two stroke bans to no wake zones to noise ordinances, the rules on Lake Tahoe can get a bit confusing. Shelly Purdy cuts through it all on tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take Pkg))                ((nats – boating))                ((Track 1)) It doesn’t get much better than this. A beautiful day out on the lake. But if you don’t know about some of the new rules on Lake Tahoe your day might be interrupted by these guys…the TRPA’s friendly watercraft team. The team’s job is to educate boaters about the rules and regulations of Tahoe…like the 600 foot no wake zone designed to reduce shoreline erosion caused by wave action. And, the 2-stroke engine ban that went into effect on June 1st of 1999.                 ((sot @ 24:16 Brian Gannon, TRPA Watercraft Team))        “The two strokes that we’re coming across these days are mostly people from out of town who didn’t read up on the regulations before they came here. They didn’t see the signs, whatever. So after you talk with them for a few minutes and educate them, give them some literature to read and explain why we’re doing this they’re quite receptive to it.”                ((s/u @ 30&gt;12 Shelly Purdy))        “So, if you see these guys coming don’t worry. You most likely won’t be getting a ticket. They’re just out here to educate you on the rules at Lake Tahoe.”                 ((sot @ 26:58 Brian Gannon, TRPA Watercraft Team))        “We are not law enforcement like sheriffs or police, so we can’t pull someone over. So we take the nice approach. We wave at them and most of the time we’ve been pretty successful at having them come to us.”                ((Track 2)) Because, the idea is not to be punitive but rather to educate the boating public about the rules on Lake Tahoe. Those rules like the 2-strike ban and no wake zone are in effect to protect water quality. That way, everyone has an opportunity to enjoy the beautiful clear blue waters of Lake Tahoe. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                Anchor Tag: In many places around Lake Tahoe there are buoys at the 600 foot from shore line. A good way to judge the distance if there is no buoy is to travel 5 minle per hour for one and a half minutes from shore. After that minute and a half, you will be 600 feet from shore.</description>

    <description>Segment 78: Eurasian Water Milfoil        Air Date: August 3, 2004                Tease @ 24:49 “A noxious weed is costing homeowners in the Tahoe Keys tens of thousands of dollars a year to deal with .I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll tell you what it is in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.”                Anchor Intro: Noxious weeds have become a big problem throughout the west, and Lake Tahoe is certainly not immune to the problem. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a look at the very invasive and very destructive Eurasian Water Milfoil.                ((Take PKG))                ((Nats – lawn mower boat cutting weeds))                ((Track 1)) Here at the Tahoe Keys on the lake’s south shore, the lawn mowers run continuously throughout the summer. What’s so different about these lawn mowers though, is that they’re working underwater…cutting a noxious weed called the Eurasian Water Milfoil.                ((sot @ 15:30 Susan Donaldson, University of Nevada Cooperative Extension Water Quality Specialist))        “Eurasian Water milfoil is what we call an exotic invasive weed. Exotic meaning it doesn’t come from north America. It comes from Eurasia. Invasive meaning once it gets in a water body it grows like crazy and takes over and displaces all the other plants that might have been there previously.”                ((Track 2)) And that’s proving to be a big problem at the Tahoe Keys. Without the lawnmowers – the boats wouldn’t be able to get through the channels at all.                ((sot @ 13:11 Greg Trischler, Water Department Manager, Tahoe Keys))        “It gets into the props and then stalls the engines and they wouldn’t be able to get to the lake. It would depreciate the value of the homes.”                ((Track 3)) But unfortunately, mowing is only a temporary fix to this growing problem at Lake Tahoe.                 ((s/u @24:01 Shelly Purdy))        “Eurasian Water Milfoil spreads very easily and can be found in just about every marina around Lake Tahoe and now it’s event in Emerald Bay.”                ((sot @ 17:17))        “Eurasian Water Milfoil spreads by little plant parts. When a boat encounters a vine and a propeller churns it up and breaks up the pieces those pieces will actually drift and float, grow roots and grow in another location.”                ((Track 4)) And since the plant loves clear, shallow water…places like marinas and Emerald Bay are the perfect habitat for it to grow. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                Anchor Tag: Researchers are testing various methods to try to find a way to control the Eurasian Water Milfoil in Lake Tahoe. Once such method uses water circulators to stir up the water around the plant since the weed doesn’t grow very well in moving water.                        WHAT CAN BOATERS DO? Reverse Propeller, Check boats before putting them in</description>

    <description>Segment 79: Dalmatian Toadflax        Air Date: August 10, 2004                Tease @ 14:58 “This sea of yellow may look pretty but it is actually a noxious weed that is harming the native environment. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll tell you all about the Dalmatian Toadflax in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.”                Anchor Intro: Anyone who has weeded a flower bed or dealt with dandelions in their lawn knows that dealing with weeds can be a real pain. Most people use some sort of herbicide to kill unwanted weeds. But when you’re dealing with noxious plants in the Tahoe area, spraying chemicals isn’t always an option. Shelly Purdy takes a look at new research to control the Dalmatian Toadflax in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take PKG))                ((Track 1)) The Dalmatian Toadflax is an invasive dry land weed that spreads easily through underground roots and seed. It likes dry gravelly sites like this spot here in the Gardnerville area.                 ((sot @ 8:26 Larry Hughes, Douglas County weed Control Supervisor))        “We know that this particular infestation here was started with a very small population of three plants which were brought from Tahoe to the valley here.”                ((Track 2)) Those three plants that were brought in as an ornamentals over the years have spread throughout the valley, up Kingsbury grade and over into the Tahoe basin. The concern with Dalmatian Toadflax is it comes in and takes over. It destroys native habitat. Animals don’t eat it. Its root system contributes to erosion. And it spreads very easily.                ((s/u @ 14:30 Shelly Purdy))        “The frightening thing about Dalmatian Toadflax is it grows directly underneath and in this case straight through sagebrush.”                ((sot @ 10:42))        “The sagebrush is normally olliopathic so what it’s doing is it puts a poison down that stops other things from growing. The Toadflax doesn’t care.”                ((track 3)) Researchers are using this area to test ways to apply a herbicide to the weeds that will kill the Toadflax and nothing else around it.                ((sot @ 12:12))        “The herbicide is put on a clipper and the plants are clipped and we’re trying to see if enough chemical will get in the plant to kill the root without harming the environment.”                ((Track 4)) A very labor intensive and time consuming proposition, but a much better alternative to allowing this non-native noxious weed take over. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                Anchor Tag: Dalmatian Toadflax can be identified with its bright yellow snapdragon shaped flowers. If you think you have this weed growing in your yard, contact your local cooperative extension office.</description>

    <description>Segment 80: Defensible Space/BMP's    Air Date: August 17, 2004                                Anchor Intro: With the Waterfall Fire so fresh on all of our minds these days, defensible space has once again become a hot topic. but in the Tahoe Basin, defensible space has to be implemented with Best Management Practices, or BMP's, in mind. Shelly Purdy has details in tonight's lake Tahoe Report.                                ((Take Pkg))                                ((Track 1)) The North Tahoe Fire Protection District has an aggressive defensible space home inspection program underway this summer. they work with homeowners and go through a checklist of items that need improvement for both fire safety and Best Management Practices. One key item of contention has long been the issue of pine needles. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency wants homeowners to leave a layer of pine needles on the ground for erosion control - part of the Best Management Practices program. The fire districts want pine needles removed.                                ((sot @ 2:48 Greg McKay, Battalion Chief, North Tahoe Fire Protection District))                &quot;For years, we've had conflicting things about pine needles and what you can and can't remove. Now they recognize that the area is overstocked and you can achieve erosion control and water quality and defensible space. They used to think that those goals were mutually exclusive. Now with a little compromise, we can accomplish all three.&quot;                                ((track 2)) that compromise is to put a layer of non-combustible material such as gravel a width of 3 to 5 feet around your home. Next to that, you can plant fire resistant vegetation or use pine needles.                                ((sot @ 22:12 Carrie Ann Capp, Nevada Tahoe Conservation District))                &quot;there's a concern in the basin about using pine needles for erosion control and the nessage that we're delivering is 3 to 5 feet from your structure and you minimize them to 1-2 inches in depth of fresh pine needles then that is a perfectly acceptable form of erosion control.&quot;                                ((track 3)) And it's also fire safe. Other important defensible space considerations are keeping tree branches at least 10 feet away from your home, keeping wood piles at least 30 feet away from your home, using irrigated landscape plants in your gardenand having the right type of roof.                                ((sot @ 3:50))                &quot;Principle and foremost when we look at a residence we look at the type of roof they have. We strongly encourage a class A roof and about 75% of the roofs in our jurisdiction are class A. the highest percentage in the basin.&quot;                                ((track 4)) Class a roofs are made of materials that are non combustible such as metal, composition or tile. Fire agencies are recommending to all homeowners with wood shake or shingle roofs that they be replaced. With the Lake Tahoe environmental education coalition, I'm Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                                Anchor Tag: Free defensible space and BMP evaluations are available to every homeowner in the Lake Tahoe Basin.

    <description>Segment 81: West Nile Virus        Air Date: August 24, 2004                Tease @ 27:45 “Washoe County Vector Control is looking for the West Nile Virus in ponds at Incline Village. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll tell you what they’ve found coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report.”                Anchor Intro: Birds found in the Incline Village and Stateline areas have tested positive for the West Nile Virus. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy tags along with Washoe County Vector Control as they test for the disease.                ((track 1)) The only way to test mosquitoes for a disease like the West Nile Virus is to capture live bugs. That’s the purpose of this contraption. Dry ice is placed in a container. As it melts it releases CO2 – which attracts mosquitoes. The bugs are trapped in a net and a small fan helps keep them flying – and alive – overnight until Vector control picks up the traps the next morning.                ((sot @ 23:00 Allen Wolff, Washoe County Vector Control))        “We’ve selected this site because it’s breeding mosquito larvae and adults are hatching out.”                ((Track 2)) They want to test actual mosquitoes for the disease after dead birds found in the Incline area tested positive for the West Nile Virus.                ((sot @ 24:39))        “Birds are actually reservoir hosts. They get bit by mosquitoes and get infected, or the mosquitoes bite the bird and get infected and then they bite people and that’s how they transmit the disease.”                ((s/u @ 27:12 Shelly Purdy))        “the types of birds that are highly susceptible to West Nile Virus are raptors like hawks and eagles and corvids like magpies and crows.”                ((track 3)) That’s why officials from Vector Control are asking anyone who finds a dead bird to give them a call. They want to hear about it. And though the threat of the West Nile Virus seems very frightening, the disease is preventable.                ((sot @ 26:10))        “It’s nothing to get really freaked out and excited about, but it’s something to be concerned about and if you take the proper precautions, you’ll be alright.”                ((Track 4)) With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.

    <description>Lake Tahoe Report Segment #82 - &quot;Lawns and Fertilizer&quot;  (Air Date: August 31, 2004). Scott Hackley from the UC Davis Tahoe Research Group discusses the importance of careful fertilizer management when watering lawns, given that runoff water with fertilizer in it can cause algae growth in the lake, impacting water clarity.</description>

    <description>Segment 82: Lawns                Air Date: August 31, 2004                                Tease @ 16:02 “The same fertilizer that you use to make grass green is making the algae grow in Lake Tahoe. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll explain in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                                Anchor Intro: Studies show that green grassy lawns may be having an impact on the quality and clarity of the water in Lake Tahoe. Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                                ((TAKE PKG))                                ((note – Tim, you might need to pull or shoot some grass video – tight shots - and the algae on rocks video))                                ((nats-water on shore))                                ((Track 1)) By looking at it on such a beautiful clear blue day, you might think what’s all this fuss over Lake Tahoe? The reality is, the lake is losing its famed crystal clarity. And at least part of the reason has to do with grassy lawns near the lake’s shore.                                ((sot @ 6:56 Scott Hackley, UC Davis Tahoe Research Group))                “Algae are a lot similar to grass or your lawns that you’re fertilizing. They love nitrogen and phosphorous that’s the food for algae. So, when you have more usage of fertilizer and that fertilizer gets into the water along shore, you’re gonna have heavy algae growth.”                                ((track 2)) And it’s that algae growth that’s becoming more and more noticeable in the lake. This fertilizer connection is a problem that researchers have known about since the 80’s, when they conducted a study of two lakefront sites.                                 ((sot @ 4:40ish))                “One site was immediately beneath a condo complex and the condo had a lawn out front near the shore of Lake Tahoe. The other site was west about 200 yards and it was beneath a pristing forested area. What they found was during one year thee was heavy algae growth on the rocks beneath the condo complex and very little growth just 200 yards west.”                                ((s/u @ 15:28 Shelly Purdy))                “This is just one example of the many lakefront properties that go right up to the lake. And even though the water is low this year, lawns like this are still having a big impact on water quality.”                                ((track 3)) Because when these lawns get watered, and that water runs off into the lake…the fertilizer goes with it. That’s why careful management of fertilizer use is so critical to the health of the lake. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                                Anchor Tag: For Lake Tahoe area property owners, the experts recommend that you only fertilize once in the spring and once in the fall. Lawns in the Tahoe area don’t need any additional fertilization during the summertime.</description>

    <description>Segment 83: Road Decommissioning        Air Date: September 7, 2004                Tease @ 13:30 “The forest service is nearing the end of a 10 year plan to improve all the unsurfaced roads in the Tahoe Basin. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll have details in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.”                Anchor Intro:         The U.S. Forest Service is responsible for the more than 400 miles of unsurfaced roads in the Tahoe Basin. They are currently in the process of either upgrading, decommissioning or converting those roads to other uses. Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take PKG))                ((Track 1)) In 1997 the forest service inventoried all the dirt roads in the Tahoe Basin…which basically meant forest service staff pounded miles and miles of dirt on foot.                ((sot @ 2:18 Mary Morgan, Acting Deputy Forest Supervisor))        “By all the roads I mean all the 2-tracks we could find. All user created roads as well as our system roads for the USFS and ended up with about 419 miles of road.”                ((track 2)) The roads were assessed using several criteria. Did the road have erosion problems? Was it a popular thoroughfare used by the public? Did the road provide access for forest management and firefighting? Once all those questions were answered, the forest service went into action. Sonce 1997, 150 miles of those roads have been improved with culverts or other drainage measures to reduce erosion. 75 miles of road have been completely decommissioned.                ((sot @ 3:35)        “If we find out that the public doesn’t need it, we don’t need it, it goes to a redundant location, we’ll actually decommission that road and take it out of service. Once a road has been decommissioned you can barely tell it was there.”                ((sot @ 13:11 Shelly Purdy))        “One of the other options is to turn a road like this that used to be 12 feet wide into trails for mountain bikers and hikers.”                ((track3)) So far, 30 miles of old dirt roads have been converted to trail. Even though this trail and road work is being done sometimes many miles away from Lake Tahoe, the purpose of it all is to improve water clarity. Erosion that can be controlled up here will mean less dirt and sediment going into the lake down below. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                Anchor Tag: One problem the forest service runs into a lot in the Tahoe Basin is user-created roads. Those roads are made when someone with an off-road vehicle goes across an untracked area. The path they create encourages others to follow and soon a road develops. The forest service wants the public to know that driving off designated dirt roads is against the law, and they encourage all off-roaders to follow posted signs.</description>

    <description>Segment 84: Clarity Data        Air Date: September 14, 2004                Tease @ 11:40        “New clarity data about Lake Tahoe is out. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll have details in the Lake Tahoe Report.”                Anchor Intro: Each week in our Lake Tahoe Report series, the overriding theme to every story is the clarity and quality of water in Lake Tahoe. So, how is the lake doing? In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a look at the very latest clarity data.                ((Take pkg))                ((Track 1)) On a day like this, Lake Tahoe looks perfect…blue water, glistening sunshine…it doesn’t get much better than this. But the reality of what’s happening to Lake Tahoe isn’t as pretty a picture.                 ((sot @ 3:52 Bob Richards, Tahoe Research Group))        “The overall long term trend still shows a loss of clarity in the lake and the rate of loss seems to be tailing off a bit, so we’re not losing the clarity at such a great rate as we were earlier, but it’s still unfortunately in the wrong direction. We’re still losing clarity in the lake at a rate of about a foot a year.                ((track 2)) Throughout the year, every year for the past several decades, Tahoe’s clarity has been measured using a secchi disk. The secchi disk readings are used to calculate the level of clarity in the water each year. Over the past few years, the rate of loss in clarity has slowed.                ((sot @ 2:28))        “We’ve had many many years of drought and the drought seems to correlate well with a reduction in the amount of materials that come into the lake through erosion, runoff, snow melt and rain. And when that happens there’s less food for algae to grow and when there’s less algae the clarity does increase.”                ((s/u @ 10:52 Shelly Purdy))        “Though the clarity data does show improvement over the last few years, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done.”                (sot@  6:35))        “What you have to realize is Tahoe responds very slowly to both negative and positive imputs to it. So, it will take many many years for us to see a turnaround in the clarity.”                ((track 3)) The good news is there are many agencies and organizations here at Tahoe dedicated to keeping this lake clear and blue. The hope is in the long run their efforts will make a difference. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                Anchor Tag: Researchers from U.C. Davis have been taking secchi disk readings at Lake Tahoe since 1968.         </description>

    <description>Segment 85: Community Fire Plan        Air Date: September 21, 2004                Tease @ 14:10 “More prescribed burning like the treatment done to this plot of land in 2001 could be in store for other areas of the Tahoe Basin. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll have details in the Lake Tahoe Report.”                Anchor Intro: The North Lake Tahoe Fire Protection District at Incline Village takes a very forward-thinking approach to protecting homes from wildfires. And now they’re teaching other fire districts how to do the same. Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe report.                ((TAKE PKG))                ((nats – waterfall fire))        ((Track 1)) This past summer, the Waterfall Fire came dangerously close to burning up and over the mountain from Carson City and into the Tahoe Basin. The forests around Tahoe are dangerously overstocked with trees. It’s a problem the Incline fire department is taking a very proactive approach to solving. For the past 20 years, they’ve utilized grant money and other funding sources to pay for a seasonal hot shot crew. The hot shots limb and cut trees, conduct prescribed burning projects and when called – fight wildfires burning in other parts of the country.                ((sot @ 8:27 Norb Szczurek, Division Chief))        “they’re a national resource for fire response, but their primary mission is doing fuels treatment in our district and throughout the Lake Tahoe Basin.”                ((track 2)) The program has been so successful at Incline that the fire department is teaching other local districts how to hire hot shots of their own. The biggest roadblock is finding the money to pay for it. Through the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, fire agencies across the country can get grant money for these types of projects, but to apply they must complete a Community Fire Plan.                ((s/u @ 13:46 Shelly Purdy))        “The Incline Fire district already has their fire plan completed. Now it’s up to the other fire districts around the lake to get their community fire plans together.”                ((sot @ 13:12)) “The federal government’s going to budget and they need it by October 1st, no later to be able to figure out who gets what funding and we certainly want to be involved in that .

    <description>Segment 88: Marine Research and Education    Air Date: October 12, 2004                                 Tease @ 25:27                &quot;You won't believe what kind of aquatic life is in Lake Tahoe 200 feet down. I'm Shelly Purdy, I'll tell you all about it in the Lake Tahoe Report.&quot;                     Anchor Intro: Third, fifth and sixth graders from throughout Northern Nevada and California are getting a unique opportunity to do some hands-on research at Lake Tahoe. Shelly Purdy has details in tonight's Lake Tahoe Report.                                 ((Take PKG))                                 ((nats boat heading out))                ((Track 1)) It's a sportfishing boat most of the year, but during the spring and fall the boat turns into a floating classroom. Today's students are all adults...out here training to be a part of the South Lake Tahoe Clean Water Team.                                 ((sot @ 21:22 Jenny Francis, Marine Research and Education, Inc.))                &quot;That's a volunteer effort where people are coming out on a regular basis and doing different kinds of water quality and clarity monitoring.&quot;                     ((track 2)) They go through the steps of taking various water quality measurements. First, by lowering a net 200 feet down in the water to collect plankton. The plankton are used as a biological measurement. Since plankton feed on algae, too many means there is a lot of algae in the water. The group also measures the ph of the water, the temperature and the amount of dissolved oxygen. They then take a secchi disk reading.                                 ((sot @ 11:32)) &quot;All it is is a white disk and we attach it to our downrigger and lower it down and you guys will all be looking off the side and when you can't see it anymore just tell me to stop and we take two measurements and average the two.&quot;                     ((track 3)) That average equals the clarity of the water. All the information collected here is recorded and shared with the various regulatory agencies working here at Lake Tahoe. The information is used as baseline data. If, at some point, they discover a problem...corrective steps can be taken. Though training clean Water Team volunteers is a vital part of this program, getting kids out on the lake is really what the Marine Research and Education program is all about.                                 ((s/u @ 24:46 Shelly Purdy))                &quot;The main thrust of the program is to get kids out on the lake to learn about Lake Tahoe, but with school budget cuts it's difficult to get kids out here on field trips. That's why they're looking for businesses to adopt a class or provide scholarship money.&quot;                     ((sot @ 23:53)) &quot;I would love to get more businesses to adopt a class to help these students for their $10 per person fee to afford these field trips. Because they've had a lot of their budget cut for field trips and place based education from where they live is very important if we want to create stewards and have responsible adults that want to stick around.&quot;                     ((track 4)) It's a small investment that pays big returns. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I'm Shelly PUrdy for KOLO NC8.                                 Anchor Tag: The field trips are available to any third, fifth or sixth grade class.

I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll take you on a tour of the Demonstration Garden tucked into the Lake Tahoe Community College…coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report.”                                                                Anchor Intro: There are two demonstration gardens at Lake Tahoe, one at Sierra Nevada College on the north shore and one at the Lake Tahoe Community College on the south shore. In tonight’s lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes us to the South Lake Tahoe garden and explains what it’s there for.                                                                ((TAKE PKG))                                                                ((track 1)) The garden is full of fall color this time of year. It’s a quiet, peaceful place to walk or sit and relax. But aside from its aesthetic value, the garden has an educational purpose.                                                                ((sot @ 8:16 Eric Larson, Backyard Conservation Program Coordinator))                                “The main purpose is the garden is to demonstrate important principles and techniques for landscaping and gardening in Lake Tahoe.”                                                                ((track 2)) Because it’s not always easy to grow things at Tahoe. Some of the challenges include a short growing season, sandy soils and high altitude. The demonstration garden is used to provide examples and acts as a place to workshops.                                                                ((sot @ 15:42))                                “We hold workshops on native and adaptive landscaping. We hold workshops on appropriate low flow irrigation systems using drip lines and micro sprays and we also hold BMP workshops.”                                                                ((s/u @ 19:25 Shelly Purdy))                                “A demonstration garden like this is a great place for people to come and see specific examples of BMP’s, planting techniques and vegetation to put in a landscape.”                                                                ((sot @ 11:49))                                “The BMP demonstration portion really goes into detail on what people can do to protect lake clarity including controlling soil erosion and runoff that eventually gets down and adds pollutants to the lake.”                                                                ((track 3)) In the BMP section of the demonstration garden you’ll find several examples of alternatives to a typical pavement driveway. There’s a new material called porous concrete and several examples of pavers – all of which allow water to infiltrate into the soil.                                                                 ((sot @ 14:02))                                “Up here is an example of a typical house, It just shows the roof of course and on the sides we have some bed planting in there.”                                                                ((track 4)) And an example of a gravel trench all designed to infiltrate water into the ground. The purpose is to show people how to make their homes look beautiful while at the same time use landscaping techniques designed to control erosion and protect Lake Tahoe. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                                                                Anchor Tag: The demonstration garden on the Sierra Nevada College campus at Incline Village is currently in the process of being moved to the college’s new location. It should be open to the public next spring.</description>

    <description>Segment 90: Lake Tahoe Elementary                Air Date: October 26, 2004                                Tease: @ 19:19 “We’re back at Lake Tahoe Elementary school where new plants have been planted. I’ll tell you what’s going on the Lake Tahoe Report.”                                Anchor Intro: Last spring, Shelly Purdy took us to Lake Tahoe Elementary School where the kids were busy mapping their school grounds in preparation for an environmental restoration project. The project is now complete. Shelly’s got a follow-up in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                                ((Track 1)) This sea of black asphalt isn’t so black anymore. There’s now green and pink and yellow and blue and lots of other colors as well. That’s because some of the asphalt has been torn out and planter boxes have been put in its place.                                  ((sot @ 6:45 Tenaya Driller, 5th Grader))                “When the water goes down the asphalt it collects all the dirt and stuff and brings it to the lake and the lake’s all dirty.”                                ((track 2)) And here at Lake Tahoe Elementary there is a lot of asphalt. So, the students took action. With help from experts at Sierra Watershed Education Partnerships, the kids took on the task of dealing with all that pavement.                                ((sot @ 16:19 Jan Ellis, Sierra Watershed Education Partnerships))                “What we’re dealing with is a lot of impervious surface, and we’re looking for opportunities for water to go into the ground and not run off. The more we can do that on our own properties the less water is rushing to the lake carrying sediment and leading to the degradation of Tahoe and its clarity.”                                ((track 3)) That’s where the planter boxes come in.                                ((s/u @ 18:52 shelly Purdy))                “The hope is these new flower beds and some of the other measures they’ve taken at Lake Tahoe Elementary will help infiltrate runoff into the soil.”                                ((sot @ 5:35 Becky Falk, 5th Grader))                “The pavement was making the water run off and the planter boxes make the water soak in.”                                ((track 4)) And now that the project is complete, it will serve as a demonstration for the rest of the community. These kids believe that if they can do it…anyone can.                                ((sot @ 7:36))                “We’re trying to get people to realize that they can do it too and they can help the lake.”                                ((sot @ 6:07))                 “I think that we’re doing a great thing for the lake to not make it so people don’t swim in oil and stuff like that.”                                ((track 5)) With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.

    <description>Segment 91: Masticator        Air Date: November 2, 2004                Tease: @ 20:26 “It’s amazing new technology to thin our overstocked forests. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll have details in the Lake Tahoe Report.”                Anchor Intro: Thinning our overstocked forests is now recognized as one of the best ways to prevent catastrophic wildfires like the Waterfall Fire in Carson City this past summer. But thinning is traditionally done by hand, and it makes for very slow and difficult work. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy shows us another option.                        ((nats???))                ((Track 1)) It’s called a masticator, and boy is it mean. It shreds huge trees in a matter of seconds and reduces them to chips. Those chips will eventually break down, passing nutrients into the soil and providing a mulch layer that helps keep in moisture. And the best part…(Tim – add file here of burn piles) no slash piles are left behind to deal with later. When the masticator comes in and does its job…that’s it. There is no more work required. Here’s how it works. The operator guides the machine through the forest removing small under story trees or “ladder fuel” trees. The healthy, dominant trees are left intact and will thrive in a more open forest.                ((sot @ 2:16 Dave Theis, Forestry Contractor))        “I put the head on the tree. There’s a rotor on the head that turns at 200 rpms, has fixed hammers on it and will literally shred the tree in place.”                ((s/u@ 19:22 Shelly Purdy))        “You might think that bringing an excavator into the forest would create quite an impact, but these machines are specially designed to tread lightly on the land.”                ((sot @ 5:38))        “The impact is negligible first and foremost because the ground pressure applied by the machine is only 5.5 pounds per square inch, but also because the machine is never tracking over the same piece of ground. We come into a stand, work that area and when it’s done, it’s done.”                ((track 2)) The masticator can also chip material on the ground such as slash or downed trees. And it can cover an average of two acres a day. But for all its advantages, the masticator does have some draw backs. The machines are very costly, and there aren’t many of them available in the United States. They are also loud, and some communities have complained about their noise. The reality is the masticator is just one tool forest officials can use to thin our forests and reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                Anchor Tag: The masticator you saw in Shelly’s report is currently being used to create a fire break in the Tahoe National Forest.</description>

    <description>Segment 92: Storm Runoff Damage                Air Date: November 16, 2004                                Anchor Intro: The Waterfall Fire in Carson City this past summer was a devastating blow to not only the community but the Carson City watershed as well. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy explains the danger residents could now face during the winter months.                                Take PKG                                ((Nats – Waterfall fire??))                                ((Track 1)) The tragedy of a catastrophic fire like this is not just in the homes damaged and lost, not just in the trees burned, firefighters injured or cost of fighting the fire. The catastrophe also lies in what’s left after the fire tears through. In this case, a charred landscape with little to no green vegetation left on the ground and a severely damaged watershed.                                ((sot @ 3:09 John Cobourn, UNR Cooperative Extension))                “Watersheds, of course, are what give us our stream flow. If we have a watershed that is disturbed by paving or some other kind of disturbance maybe logging of if it’s been burned, it’s going to behave a lot differently than an undisturbed watershed that might have a lot of vegetation in it.”                                ((track 2)) In a natural and undisturbed watershed the trees and other vegetation act like a sponge. During a rain event, their root systems and the duff layer on the ground absorb water and help it soak in. But in a disturbed watershed, there’s nothing left on the ground to do that.                                ((sot @ 4:30))                “In the burned watersheds where we had the big fire in Carson City the Waterfall Fire this summer, the neighborhoods at the foot of Ash Canyon and BC Canyon are at risk for something that could be quite hazardous…a debris flow…where the whole upper watershed could slide down because it doesn’t have the vegetation to hold the soil in place.”                                ((nats – strong rain fall – if you have it))                                ((track 3)) This, most likely, could only happen in a major rain on show event during the wintertime or a large thunderstorm with flash flooding during the summertime. The homes at the edge of the watershed are at greatest risk.                                ((sot @ 4:54))                “There are some neighborhoods and some areas that are at risk for having high velocity debris really like a mudflow with boulders in it that could come down with high velocity into some neighborhoods.”                                ((track 4)) It’s a devastating legacy the Waterfall Fire is leaving Carson City. What took flames just days to destroy will take the community years to repair. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.

    <description>Segment 93: Watermaster                Air Date: November 23, 2004                                Anchor Intro: Living in Northern Nevada means we live in the high desert, and there is a limited amount of water to go around. It’s the job of the federal watermaster to regulate just how much water is released fro Lake Tahoe and other storage reservoirs into the Truckee and Carson Rivers. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy introduces us to Watermaster Garry Stone.                                Take PKG                                ((Track 1)) There is no water behind the dam at Tahoe City these days. What little water there is in the Truckee River here is coming from seepage and underground springs. You might think of Lake Tahoe as just a recreational playground, but it’s much more than that. Lake Tahoe is also a water storage reservoir. The dam at Tahoe City was built to hold and keep up to 750,000 acre feet of water stored in Lake Tahoe.                                ((sot @ 9:11 Garry Stone, Watermaster))                 “Without the Tahoe dam which stores 6.1 feet vertically on the natural lake, the lake would go below the rim every year because if there was no dam to catch the water that ran into the lake it would just run over at Tahoe City and on down the Truckee.”                                ((track 2)) It’s the job of Watermaster Garry Stone to keep track of all the water coming in and out of Lake Tahoe and other area reservoirs. It’s a juggling act of storing and releasing to make sure enough water goes down the Truckee into Reno and beyond. And even though there’s very little water left in upstream reservoirs right now, the watermaster’s first priority, by law, is to maintain what’s called the Floriston Rate.                                 ((sot @  2:44))                 “I have to follow the guidelines of the federal court decree and in the case of the Truckee it’s fairly easy to explain in that we have to maintain the Floriston Rates and those are flow rates that must be maintained at Stateline.”                                ((track 3)) The Floriston rate ensures that there is enough water coming into the Reno area to supply the community, farming, fish and wildlife interests. In a drought like we’re in now, the watermaster isn’t storing any water at all. He is required, above all, to maintain the Floriston Rate.                                ((sot @ 4:54))                “We can’t store now because my first mandate is to maintain the Floriston Rate. Whatever period of year we’re in that rate must be maintained and I cannot store until we get back up to that prescribed rate.”                                ((track 4)) During times of flood or drought, requirements like the Floriston Rate aren’t well understood by the general public. And the watermaster’s office frequently gets criticized for the job they do.                                 ((sot @ 3:28))                “Of course, there are those folks who are unhappy with not enough or too much water in the river. Tahoe’s either too high or too low. And we encourage people to call and we’re more than happy to explain to them why we have to do what we do at Tahoe and the Truckee River.”                                ((track 5)) With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                                Anchor Tag: Garry Stone has worked in the watermaster’s office for 37 years and has served as the Federal Watermaster for 20 years.</description>

I’ll tell you if that means wet or dry conditions. That’s coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report.”                                                                Anchor Intro: Forecasters talked a lot about El Nino and La Nina during the late 90’s. They are now predicting this winter will be a mild El Nino. So, what does that mean for our winter storm forecast? Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                                                                Take PKG                                                                ((track 1)) The water is getting warmer in the Pacific Ocean…right along the equator west of South America. That’s where El Nino and La Nina are measured.                                                                ((sot @ 5:37 Gary Barbato, National Weather Service))                                “Basically if the temperature of the water in the equatorial pacific is greater than ½ a degree Celsius above the norm, you’re barely into the El Nino category.”                                                                ((track 2)) And conversely, if the water temperature gets colder, that’s a La Nina. If this change in temperature happens for five months in a row, that means El Nino or La Nina are coming. And since the water is getting warmer in the equatorial Pacific, but not by much, forecasters are predicting a mild El Nino this winter. What does that mean for the Reno/Tahoe area? Maybe nothing.                                                                ((sot @ 6:43))                                “A weak El Nino doesn’t really mean a whole lot. We’ve had some record dry years and some wet years during this same kind of scenario.”                                                                ((sot @ 9:36))                                “El Nino’s got to be very strong for it to make a big difference for us. And when that is the case, very strong, you will expect a wet winter. But during a weak El Nino, not the case.”                                                                ((Track 2)) The reason is the Reno/Tahoe area sits right on the line of how El Ninos affect weather patterns in our region. During a strong El Nino, the south is wetter than normal and the north is drier. Since Reno and Tahoe are right on that north/south line, the El Nino must be very strong to give us wet weather.                                                                 ((sot @ 7:49))                                “What we’re looking for this year at least for the first part of winter is close to average precipitation. The long range going out to next spring maybe get us a little bit above average during those months, but we’ll have to wait and see.”                                                                (standup tape @ 6:37 Shelly Purdy))                                 “The bottom line is it’s still a craps shoot. We won’t know what this winter brings until it’s over. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.”                                                                Anchor Tag: By the way, El Ninos don’t just affect the weather in our region. The Pacific Ocean covers about a quarter of the globe, so changes in the water’s temperature have an impact around the world.</description>

    <description>Segment 95: Drought                Air Date: December 7, 2004                                Anchor Intro: Despite a big snowstorm in October and another one over Thanksgiving weekend, we are in the middle of a drought. The last year we had a normal amount of precipitation was in 1999. And 2001 was a record dry year. Shelly Purdy explains the drought situation in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                                ((Take PKG))                                ((track 1)) Five years of drought have taken their toll on the water supply in the Sierra. Lake Tahoe is below its natural rim, and there is no water at all going through the Tahoe City Dam. The Truckee River is nearly dry in spots. And the situation in other area reservoirs is equally as bad. The recent rainfall we’ve had has been good to get some water back into the ground, but so far it hasn’t done much to improve the drought situation. Though the current water year has started off well, it’s going to take a record breaker to recover from so many years of drought.                                ((sot @ 17:57 Gary Barbato, National Weather Service))                “In an extremely wet year you can get a lot in a hurry, but those years are very rare.”                                ((track 2)) The good news is it’s only December and the winter months which typically bring the heaviest amount of precipitation are still to come. The other good news, there’s healthy amount of snow in the mountains. It is the snowpack that will determine just how much water fills our reservoirs this spring and summer.                                ((sot @ 15:06 Gary Barbato, National Weather Service))                “We have two kinds of reservoirs in the Sierra. We have snowpack and the reservoirs which hold melted water. The snow can hold an incredible amount of water and the snow keeps that water up in the mountains until it melts. Rather than if we have a warm storm it’ll all go into the reservoirs. It wouldn’t really help us We want water in the reservoirs and the snowpack to give us water supply through the summer.”                                ((track 3)) So what does this winter have in store for us? Forecasters are predicting average precipitation. If that happens, it probably won’t be enough to fill Lake Tahoe and bump us out of the drought. But then again, you never know…                                ((s/u @ 6:37 standup tape, Shelly Purdy))                “The bottom line is it’s still a kraps shoot. We won’t know what this winter brings until it’s over. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.”                                                Anchor Tag: One little bit of weather trivia…of the ten wettest Octobers on record, seven of those years ended up with average or above average precipitation. Since this past October ranks sixth in that top ten, we might have a chance at a big winter.</description>

    <description>Segment 96: Climate Change        Air Date: December 14, 2004                Anchor Intro: A group called the Sierra Nevada Alliance is out with a troubling new report on how global warming and climate change could affect the Sierra snow pack. Scientists from the Desert Research Institute, the US Geological Survey and University of California all contributed to the report. Shelly Purdy takes a closer look in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((Take PKG))                ((Track 1)) 65 percent of northern California’s and nearly 100 percent of northwestern Nevada’s water supply comes from the Sierra snow pack. The scientific data gathered in the Alliance’s new report called “Troubled Waters of the Sierra” raises concerns about what could happen to that snow pack over the next century.                ((sot @ 3:47 Joan Clayburgh, Sierra Nevada Alliance))        “All the scientists who are looking at climate change say we’re going to see a 2 ½ to 10 degree rise in the temperature and what that means for snow is less snow. And why we care about that for water is snow is a great storage system. It comes down in the winter and stores that water and slowly melts over the spring and summer.”                ((track 2)) If wintertime temperatures rise, instead of snow…rain would fall. And it’s impossible to capture and store all that rain. That’s why the Sierra Nevada Alliance put out this report. It’s a wake-up call of sorts to encourage better planning, conservation and preparation for the future.                ((sot @ 5:48))        “We’re concerned about planning. When we relicense a dam or look at future growth and putting new houses in and what are they looking at? Our concern is they look at the last 100 years and expect that to be the future, so they expect the water to keep working the way it has. The snow to keep coming down in the same way. And that’s clearly not true.”                ((track 3)) Climate scientists estimate that in 50 years there will be 50-percent less snow pack in the Sierra. And in 100 years, our wintertime snow pack will be nearly 90-percent less than it is today. Numbers like that are certainly troubling, but it’s not too late to take action.                ((sot @ 6:49))        “The more efficient we are with water the less dependent we are on a lot of water. They make washers and dryers that use less water. If you put in low flow showerheads in your home. If you buy homes with landscaping that doesn’t require as much water that you like and looks nice. All of that makes it easier for you to adapt to a future maybe where we’re going to have less water.”                ((track 4)) With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.

    <description>Segment 97: Drinking Water Ozonation                Air Date: December 21, 2004                                Tease @ 13:25                “Most people think of ozone as a bad thing. Here at Incline Village they’re using ozone to treat their water. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll have the story on the Lake Tahoe Report.”                                Anchor Intro: The Incline Village General Improvement District is using ozone to treat their community’s drinking water. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, shelly Purdy explains how this low-cost yet highly effective method works.                                ((TAKE PKG))                                ((Track 1)) This is all you can see of the process of making ozone…a few tiny sparks of electricity deep inside a specially designed ozone generator.                                 ((sot @ 8:13 Dan St. John, Incline Village GID))                “Probably the most complex part of the operation is the ozone generation itself. The ozone molecule is oxygen 3. As you know the air we breathe is O2. So we make ozone from oxygen because you can’t go to the store and buy a bottle of ozone. It doesn’t last.”                                ((s/u @ 12:58 Shelly Purdy))                “This is where the ozone is made. It’s made by pumping 9000 volts of electricity through tubes of pure oxygen.”                                ((track 2)) By zapping the gasified liquid oxygen with high voltage electricity…ozone gas is created. Once the gas is made, it’s mixed with the water.                                 ((sot @ 7:23))                “…The ozone gas is introduced to the water and allowed to mix and allowed to remain in contact with the water for a specified duration and during that time the ozone is a very effective oxidant.”                                ((track 3)) Ozone is such a powerful disinfectant that it can kill even the most troublesome of pathogens like giardia and cryptosporidium. The only problem with ozone is can be very harmful to the environment. That’s why once the ozone is used to disinfect the drinking water, a chemical is added to deactivate any residual ozone. Also, any extra ozone gas that collects in the system is run through an ozone destruction unit. No ozone is ever released into the atmosphere. Treating their drinking water with ozone has helped the Incline Village GID save money, lower the amount of chemicals they use in their drinking water and produce a high quality water for their customers. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                                Anchor Tag: One side note…a small amount of chlorine is added to Incline’s water after it goes through the ozonation process. The chlorine is needed to keep the water pure as it moves through the community’s pipeline system.</description>

    <description>Segment 98: Car Wash        Air Date: December 28, 2004                Anchor Intro: Northern Nevada and California are in the midst of a five-year drought. That means water is in short supply. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes us to an unlikely place for water conservation…Truckee’s Cross Roads Car Wash.                ((TAKE PKG))                ((track 1)) Believe it or not, the Cross Roads Car Wash recycles 90-percent of the water it uses. But that doesn’t mean these cars are being washed with dirty water. The recycled water pumping out of this wash is nearly as clean as the water that comes from the tap thanks to some European technology and a simple, yet state of the art reclamation system.                ((sot @ 9:13 Mark Lowenstern, Cross Roads Car Wash))        “the cars come out clean and shiny and there’s no difference except that locally people are environmentally conscious and they thank me for the fact that I’m saving thousands of gallons a week.”                ((Track 2)) Not only is he saving water, but money as well in reduced water and sewer fees. This is the way the system works: as the soapy dirty water drips off the cars it drains into a series of 15-hundred gallon holding tanks. The water is kept moving 24 hours a day and eventually makes its way through the equipment room.                ((Sot @ 7:51))        “Where the water is aerated and filtrated and there’s natural enzymes to eat all the bacteria, so it sort of functions as a stream would naturally flow downstream where it’s constantly moving and gets the oxygen in the system and the sediment settles to the bottom.”                ((track 3)) And the specially designed biodegradable soap that is used in the car wash actually helps in that process to clean the water. The reclaimed water is then put back into the system and is used over and over again to clean cars. The only fresh water that is used is in the final rinsing process. Lowenstern says he installed this reclamation system because it’s not only good for business, it’s good for the environment as well. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                        Anchor Tag: Mark Lowenstern has a background in engineering. He purchased his water reclamation system from a European company and put the entire system together himself.</description>

    <description>Segment 99: Pathway 2007        Air Date: 1/4/05                Anchor intro: The regulatory agencies at Lake Tahoe are asking for the public’s help in creating a master plan that will guide how the Lake Tahoe Basin is managed over the next 20 years. Shelly Purdy explains how you can get involved in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((TAKE PKG))                ((track 1)) The planning process is being called Pathway 2007. The US Forest Service, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, Lahontan Water Quality Control Board and Nevada Division of Environmental Protection are working together to develop a master plan of sorts for the Tahoe Basin.                 ((sot @ 1:15 Rex Norman, U.S Forest Service)        “What decisions they’ll make about how to manage resources, how to manage growth, how to manage recreation, how to manage future plans for recreation holistically for the basin. Each one of these agencies is doing their planning but they’re doing it in cooperation with one another.”                ((track 2)) The goal with Pathway 2007 is to create an overall management plan that will encourage the agencies at Tahoe to work together, increase cooperation and decrease duplication of efforts. The key to creating this plan is input from the public.                ((sot @ 3:48))        “With that in mind we have a series of five different visioning workshops at the very beginning of this planning process which will allow the public to share with us their values, ideas and expectations about what a successful future of the management of Lake Tahoe would be like”                ((track 3)) There will be two meetings held at Lake Tahoe on January 8th and 12th. The other meetings will be held in Southern California, Las Vegas and San Francisco. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News channel 8.

From environmental science to environmental literature to political science…the study options in the environmental field are widely varied. The problem is many students and faculty don’t know about the different choices and options are. And that’s where the Academy for the Environment comes in.

It’s essentially a clearing house where students can go to find environmental programs available on campus.

Not to compete with them or take their place, but to help them meet their own needs but to also create collaborative opportunities for folks in different colleges to work together who may not know each other.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((track 2)) A new website will soon be developed, an office will be established and staff will be hired to assist students and faculty with finding the various environmental programs currently available on campus.

At least one forestry expert says not enough is being done to prevent that from happening. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy talks to Dr Thomas Bonnicksen about the issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Take PKG                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((track 1)) Now that the snow has fallen, it is safe to burn the slash piles that dot the forests around Lake Tahoe. These piles are what’s left over when hand crews go into an area and thin the small trees in the forest. It’s often too costly and difficult to remove the slash, so the piles sit until conditions are right to burn them. There are other methods like a machine called a masticator that cuts trees and reduces them to chips. But overall, this method of clearing and pile burning is the standard the forest service is currently using to thin sections of overstocked forest in the Tahoe Basin. And that is troubling to forest historian Dr. Thomas Bonnicksen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((sot @ 1:59 Thomas Bonnicksen, Ph. D., Professor Emeritus of Forest Science, Texas A &amp; M University))                                                                                                                                “We just have too many trees. Historically in the Sierra Nevada we had about 60 trees per acre, Now we have 460 of all sizes. The forest can’t support that.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((Track 2)) Bonnicksen believes the forest service is wasting its time and money on thinning and pile burning projects. And, he says these small-scale projects aren’t enough to protect the forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((sot @ 4:50ish))                                                                                                                                “For example, they’re planning a thinning project in the Tahoe Basin that they say will take $100 million to do on 24,000 acres. There are 200,000 acres of forest up there that area ready to burn. And the reason they’re going to the taxpayers is because they don’t want to cut any of the trees that might be valuable and might help pay the cost. They only want to cut the little trees with no value.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((track 3)) Bonnicksen believes the forests should be opened up to tightly controlled logging. Foresters would go into a tract of land and select a variety of trees for cutting based on science. The trees left would be of varying sizes and species. And the forest would look more like it did historically. Under his plan, foresters would pay to log the trees, saving taxpayers money. But, there are some significant challenges to Bonnicksen’s plan. Logging could mean damage to sensitive habitat, erosion issues and extensive road building. Another factor is the political feasibility of logging. Convincing the public to open up Tahoe’s forests to logging would be tough enough. But also asking them to allow new backcountry roads to be built could be next to impossible. But Bonnicksen isn’t deterred. He believes his plan is the right one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((sot @ 5:50))                                                                                                                                “People use the word logging. It’s kind of a pejorative term. I am a forest historian. I think of cutting trees as a creative process. It’s not the process of removing something. It’s the process of recreating a healthy, fire resistant forest that’s natural.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ((track 4)) With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO NC8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Anchor Tag: Forest service officials say Bonnicksen’s estimate of 200-thousand acres at Tahoe being ready to burn is a gross exaggeration. They say only 55-thousand acres are currently at risk for catastrophic wildfire and more than half of that has already been thinned. Dr. Bonnicksen will present his ideas to the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency on January 26th.</description>

We have a lot of non-native species issues that we have to deal with because it’s a complex issue.”                                                                ((track 2))  With help from funding through the Nevada Biodiversity Initiative, researchers are working on a way to make it happen. And the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout isn’t the only species the Initiative is working on. The goal of the program is to look at all of Nevada’s fish, plant and animal life and figure out how they’re doing.                                                                ((Sot @ 3:20))                                “All of this is under this larger mandate to understand enough about these species so that we can meet out development needs as the state grows without endangering species on the landscape.”                                                                ((track 3)) The hope is that by inventorying and assessing the status of various species within the state of Nevada, planners will be able to maintain and preserve the wide diversity of plant and animal life there is.

    <description>Segment A103: Hybrid Car                Air Date: February 1, 2005                                Tease @ 18:03                “Out of about 2,000 of these Ford Hybrid Escape SUVs made…this is #43 off the production line. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll tell you about the company that’s using it coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report.”                                Anchor Intro: Look around town these days and just about every other car you see is an SUV. But with gas prices at an all time high, driving a big SUV can be tough on the pocketbook…and tough on the environment. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy introduces us to a Truckee-based company that’s found a more economical and environmentally friendly alternative.                                ((TAKE PKG))                                ((Track 1)) The Village at Northstar is undergoing a transformation. Developer East West Partners has torn down many of the old buildings. They are in the process of creating a new village complete with condominium units, restaurants and shops and even an ice skating rink. But this is no ordinary construction project. Everything here is being built with the environment in mind.                                ((s/u @ 20:20 Shelly Purdy))                “The steel in these buildings up here contain up to 80% recycled material. Northstar’s commitment to the environment extends well beyond construction into other areas of the business.”                                ((sot @ 1:57 Aaron Revere, Director of Environmental Initiatives, East West Partners))                “In addition to that in the buildings we look at other things in terms of operation whether it’s in recycling or driving fun vehicles trying out new technologies things that help a business perform better on the environmental standpoint without compromising your business quality.”                                ((track 2)) One of those new technologies East West Partners is trying out is the brand new Ford Escape Hybrid SUV. The first thing you notice about this Hybrid SUV is it looks exactly the same as the gas powered version of the car. It’s 4WD, it has leather seats, it comes complete with all the standard features, it’s the same size and has the same power and performance as the all-gasoline powered Escape SUV. The difference is this Hybrid gets about 30 miles to the gallon and is much cleaner for the environment. Director of Environmental Initiatives, Aaron Revere, has been waiting for this car for a long time. As part of their commitment to the environment, East West Partners is testing out the car’s Hybrid technology. They hope to expand their corporate fleet once more Hybrid SUVs and trucks become available.                                ((sot @ 5:47))                 “We as a company want better performing products on the environmental standpoint whether it be in buildings like this or cars like this, so from a corporate standpoint it’s the right thing to do.”                                ((track 3)) Revere says by driving this new Hybrid Escape SUV, he and his company are supporting the technology. And he hopes that support will help increase demand and encourage car companies to produce more environmentally friendly vehicles. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                                Anchor Tag: The Ford Hybrid Escape SUV is the first four-wheel-drive vehicle available with hybrid technology. Though these cars are extremely popular and there is even a waiting list to purchase them, Ford only made about 2-thousand of the cars. Chevy will soon begin selling full-sized four-wheel-drive trucks with Hybrid technology.</description>

    <description>Segment #A104                Light Pollution                Air Date: 2/15/05                                Tease @ 21:25                &quot;Something you probably haven't thought much about...light pollution                 and                 lake Tahoe. I'm shelly Purdy, I'll have that story coming up on the                 Lake                 Tahoe Report.&quot;                                Anchor Intro: We all need lights to see at night, but just how much                 light is really necessary for safety and security is becoming an issue                 at Lake Tahoe. In tonight's Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a                 look                 at the growing controversy over light pollution.                                ((TAKE PKG))                                ((Track 1)) Lake Tahoe at sunset is an amazing sight to see. And once                 the sun goes down, you'd expect   there to be nearly complete darkness.                 This is, afterall, the mountains. There are no big cities up here to                 flood the night sky with light. But there are other sources...like the                 big lights of the night skiing operation at Squaw Valley.                                ((sot @ 7:02 Dr. Paul Guttman, Space Science for Schools))                &quot;Here's the situation. We have an economic reason for those lights to                 be                 on and that's night skiing. But those lights are on from dusk till dawn                 long after any nighttime skiing is being offered at 11pm when the                 mountain is closed.&quot;                                ((Tradk 2)) Dr. Paul Guttman is working with the Tahoe Regional                 Planning                 Agency on the issue of light pollution. He says the TRPA has rules                 about                 lighting on the books, but does little to enforce them. Dr. Guttman                 believes the issue is not just with big properties like Squaw Valley,                 but                 with small property owners as well. This light sits at the end of a                 boat                 dock at Incline Village. It is so bright and gives off so much glare,                 it                 can be seen from all the way across the lake.                                ((sot @ 3:31))                &quot;Lights that produce glare by direct open bulbs do not really help us                 in                 terms of security or actually seeing.&quot;                                ((s/u @ 20:47 Shelly Purdy))                &quot;This unprotected light bulb here is exactly what Dr. Guttman is                 talking                 about by a light that's done nothing but produce excess glare which is                 magnified by the snow around it.&quot;                                ((Track 3)) That reflectivity is called the &quot;albedo effect.&quot; That's why                 glare and light pollution can be worse in the wintertime than in the                 summertime...since the light is magnified by the white snow. Dr.                 Guttman                 doesn't want to get rid of our lights altogether. But he does recommend                 using sensor lights that only come on when needed, turning light                 fixtures downward so they light the ground below and not the night sky,                 and turning off lights when they're not needed. With the Lake Tahoe                 Environmental Education Coalition, I'm Shelly PUrdy for KOLO News                 Channel 8.                                Anchor Tag: The public is encouraged to make their opinions heard about                 light pollution. The TRPA is currently reviewing their thresholds for                 light pollution as a part of the Pathway 2007 management plan.

    <description>Segment A129: Sewage Spill Follow-up	    Air Date; August 2, 2005        Tease @ 30:07 “What effect has the sewage spill in Kings Beach had away from the shoreline? I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll have all that information for you coming up on this week’s lake Tahoe report.”        Anchor intro: A sewer line break near Kings Beach two weeks ago resulted in the release of some 120-thousand gallons of raw sewage spilling directly into Lake Tahoe. Health officials closed the beaches near the spill and have spent the past two weeks cleaning up the site. But what effect does a spill like this have on the overall clarity of Tahoe? Shelly Purdy takes a look in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.        TAKE PKG        ((Track 1)) The obvious immediate effects of a sewage spill of this magnitude are concerns regarding public health and safety. Raw sewage contains pathogenic bacteria, viruses and other parasites such as giardia and cryptosporidium…all of which can make a person very sick. The first order of business after the sewer line break was to contain the spill and start the cleanup process. Nearby beaches were closed causing a huge impact on local businesses. But, now that the beaches have reopened and the spill has been contained…what are the long-term effects to the water quality of Lake Tahoe?        ((sot @ 25:03 John Reuter, Tahoe Environmental Research Group))    “It probably won’t have an effect on the lake as a whole. It will have a local effect. There might be more algae growing on the rocks…that attached algae. That will probably be impacted by that.”        ((track 2)) In the late 1960’s scientists recognized the potential threat sewage has to the quality and clarity of Lake Tahoe. A highly sophisticated system was built to export all the raw sewage generated around Tahoe out of the basin.         ((sot @ 26:10))    “All the sewage gets exported either up to Truckee or down south and out of the basin. So in large part, this whole system has been a very positive thing.”        ((track 3)) If that system had never been built…a sewage spill like this would almost be a moot point. Sewage contains high levels of nutrients…which contribute to the growth of algae in the lake. Keeping sewage out of the lake over the past 30 years has certainly helped to protect Tahoe’s quality and clarity. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO news Channel 8.        Anchor Tag: Many people have asked the question why are sewer lines located so close to the lake’s shore? The sewer lines were built near the lake to accommodate the large number of homes and businesses that are located close to shore. Also, the shoreline of Lake Tahoe has eroded and changed over the years. So, pipes that once were on land may very well now be under water.                         </description>

    <description>Segment A105: Winter Trek    Air Date: February 22, 2005        Tease @ 29:41 “The Winter Trek program is for 5th graders and runs from January through March. I’m shelly Purdy, in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report I’ll take you snowshoeing at Heavenly.”        Anchor Intro: Many children who live in the Reno and Carson City areas and even kids who live in the Tahoe area don’t often get the chance to participate in an outdoor wintertime sport like snowshoeing. But thanks to the generosity of Heavenly Ski Resort and the U.S. Forest Service…hundreds of fifth graders are now getting that chance. Shelly Purdy has details in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.        ((TAKE PKG))        ((nats – kids getting off gondola))        ((Track 1)) Heavenly Ski Resort provides tickets to ride the gondola free of charge for all the kids who participate in the Winter Trek program. Their first stop is the observation deck where they get a bit of a science lesson about Lake Tahoe.        ((natsot@ 8:28 Gay Eitel, USFS Information Assistant))    “Here we’re standing looking at all three phases of matter at the same time. Water is the liquid form. Solid ice or snow and the clouds that’s the gaseous form.”        ((Track 2)) Gay Eitel has been involved with the Winter Trek program for 18 years. This is the first year they’ve been able to take the kids up on Heavenly’s new gondola. Bringing them high up here allows Gay to talk to the kids about everything from Lake Tahoe’s history to science to just who owns much of the Forest Service land they are looking at.        ((natsot @ 9:53))    “Who owns most of that that you see out there? You guys do! It belongs to the people.”        ((track 3)) One of the goals of this program is to instill a sense of ownership and respect for Lake Tahoe. And after the kids get a chance to take in the view…they pile back into the gondola and head to the top. This is where the fun part of Winter Trek begins.        ((natsot @ 13:51))    “”There is really only one way to put your snowshoes on if they’re gonna stay on.”        ((Track 4)) Learning how to decipher detailed instructions is a part of the fifth grade curriculum, so the kids are told step-by-step how to put on their snowshoes. They are encouraged to do it themselves, and once the snowshoes are on, everyone takes a quick test run before setting-off into the forest. Along their trek, they look for animal tracks, talk about the homes animals make and how they survive in the wintertime.        ((s/u @ 29:08 Shelly Purdy))    “It’s a very short one and a half to two hour trip, but this experience really opens the eyes of a lot of kids.”        ((sot @ 28:04))    “It’s great to be able to see the light come on in kids eyes when they learn something out here. You don’t get to see that as much, but you’ll find one every time that is just thrilled to find a squirrel track of one that is so excited that they can do this.”        ((track 5)) Gay believes her job is to light a spark in these kids and let their teachers build the fires. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.        Anchor Tag: Each student is asked to pay two-dollars to participate in the Winter Trek program. The money covers the cost of repairing broken snowshoes and provides a cup of hot chocolate at the end of the day.</description>

    <description>Segment A106: Ski With a Ranger    Air Date: March 1, 2005        Tease @ 12:12 “Heavenly Ski Resort partners with the US Forest Service on educational programs. I’m Shelly Purdy…coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report, I’ll show you the ski with a ranger program here at Heavenly.”        Anchor Intro: If you’ve ever been out skiing and wondered what kind of trees you’re flying past or what kind of animal made those tracks in the snow, there is a place where you can find the answers to your questions. Heavenly Ski Resort partners with the US Forest Service on the “Ski With a Ranger” program. Shelly Purdy explains how it works in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.        ((TAKE PKG))        ((natsot@ 1:15))    “Have you been on the gondola yet? ‘No.’ About half way up there’s a mid section. I would suggest getting off there and that’s probably the best views of Lake Tahoe.”        ((Track 1)) Giving out advice about where to find the best views of Lake Tahoe is just one small part of the job. Michael St. Michelle and other Forest Service rangers who participate in the Ski With a Ranger program field a wide variety of questions ranging from what kind of trees there are up here to what kinds of tracks.        ((natsot @ 2:22))    “We’ve been seeing a lot of coyote tracks. That area’s full of coyotes in there…probably not squirrels because they’re kind of small. And we do have bears in there, so it could have been some bears.        ((track 2)) There are two parts to the Ski With a Ranger program. There is the roving program where rangers position themselves at various points throughout the mountain and answer questions….and there’s also guided tours.        ((sot @ 5:42 Michael St. Michelle, U.S. Forest Service))    “We do a guided tour that we do at 10:30 and 1:30 and those are one and a half hours long and are more natural history what people will see when they’re skiing which is mainly the trees. We talk about the wildlife that might be found on the ski resort.        ((Track 3)) It’s a public program that’s free of charge, and it’s just one aspect of what the Forest Service does here at Heavenly.        ((s/u @ 11:37 Shelly Purdy))    “Since Heavenly Ski Resort sits on public land the Forest Service is heavily involved in how everything is managed here even during the wintertime months.”        ((sot @ 8:29))    “the USFS provides a lot of guidelines for Heavenly to go by in operating these resorts. If they want to expand or open a new run or change the way things work around here, we have people that work really closely with them.”        ((Track 4)) Everything from inspecting chairlifts, to monitoring erosion to skiing with the public…the Forest Service has quite a presence here at Heavenly. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.        Anchor Tag: One of the main goals of the “Ski With a Ranger” program is to inform the public that when they’re skiing at Heavenly and other resorts in the Tahoe Basin, they’re skiing on public land.</description>

    <description>Segment A107: Incline Lake    Air Date: March 8, 2005        Tease @ 28:42 “This half buried home here is a part of the Incline Lake Corporation. It’s a very private, very secret, wonderful piece of property at the top of Mt. Rose. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll take you on an exclusive tour coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report.”        Anchor Intro: Incline Lake sits near the top of the Mount Rose Highway. It is a unique piece of private property surrounded by tens of thousands of  acres of Forest Service land. It’s vicinity to Lake Tahoe and it’s incredible surroundings make the property very desirable to developers. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes us on an exclusive tour of Incline Lake and explains how the current owners are trying to work out a deal to sell the land to the Forest Service.        ((TAKE PKG))        ((track 1)) Incline Lake has a very colorful past. The property was once owned by flamboyant millionaire George Whittell who, at the time, owned nearly all of Lake Tahoe’s east shore. Whittell sold the property in 1939 and it became the Incline Lake Corporation. The property is divided into 28 shares. 20 shareholders currently own interest in the Corporation. Some of Nevada’s and some of Hollywood’s biggest movers and shakers have spent time at Incline Lake over the years.        ((sot @ 17:42 Glen Williams, Terra Firma, Land Use Consultants))    “This lake was the first place that Lucille Ball ever caught a trout. On the back of the deck of the clubhouse there one of the board members told us that Bill Lear and Howard Hughes are sitting down drawing jet designs on cocktail napkins. Supreme Court justices have stayed here…all kinds of interesting folks.”        ((track 2)) The property includes the lake, six buildings ranging from a clubhouse to a 14-thousand square foot lodge with a telescope and indoor swimming pool, small cabins and a caretaker’s home. The parcel was split into a 40-lot subdivision decades ago…though that subdivision was never developed. And, 56 of Incline Lake’s 777 total acres actually sits outside the area of the Tahoe Basin…making it extremely attractive to developers.        ((sot @ 21:40))    “It appears that there is a phenomenal amount of coverage associated with this property which is land the TRPA recognizes as buildable land coverage.”        ((track 3)) But instead of selling to a developer, the shareholders owners want the Forest Service to buy it so the land can be opened to the public.        ((s/u @ 27:31 Shelly Purdy))    “If the sale of this Incline Lake property really does to through with the Forest Service it’s an incredible opportunity to put an amazing piece of property into public hands, if the sale does not go through, the property could very well be purchased by a developer.”        ((sot@  19:20))    “They are willing sellers of course. It all depends on the final appraised value. But there is a group of the shareholders that would like to see this protected in perpetuity and would like to see the benefit that some of their families have enjoyed carried over to the public at large.”        ((track 4)) The property has been listed for consideration under the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act where surplus lands in Southern Nevada is sold to purchase more desirable and environmentally sensitive lands in other parts of the state. Whether it all happens still remains to be seen. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.        Anchor Tag: The forest Service is very interested in purchasing the land, but they do not want the responsibility of maintaining the buildings on the property. Washoe County has stepped-in and offered to build parking and trailheads at the site and also manage the buildings. The land owners have said if the deal goes through, they will give the county an endowment to help pay the cost of managing the property.</description>

    <description>Segment A109: New Clarity Research                Air Date: 3/22/05                                Suggested Tease (none on tape): Researchers have pinpointed what they believe may be the single greatest problem causing the loss of clarity in Lake Tahoe. Shelly Purdy will have all the details of this new research coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report.                                Anchor Intro: Over the past two years in our weekly Lake Tahoe Reports, Shelly Purdy has reported on everything from algae growth to excess nitrogen to sediment as causes of Lake Tahoe’s declining clarity. New research has now narrowed those choices down to one primary cause of clarity loss. Shelly has details in tonight’s lake Tahoe Report.                                ((TAKE PKG))                                ((nats – lake shore))                ((Track 1)) Despite a lot of talk about the “greening” of Lake Tahoe…this body of water is still one of the bluest and clearest in the world. Millions of dollars are being spent and hundreds of thousands of man-hours are being used to protect Lake Tahoe. But what, exactly, does it need protecting from? Researchers have known for a long time that sediment is a problem…but new research suggests it’s the tiniest of particles…about 10 microns or 1/10 of a millimeter in size…that are really causing all the trouble.                                ((sot @ 2:12 Brendan Ferry, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))                “Those particles remain suspended in the moving water column of the lake and refract sunlight which makes the lake look less clear or a little more cloudy.”                                ((Track 2)) And the thing that makes these tiny particles even more damaging is the fact that they never really settle to the bottom. In effect, every teeny tiny speck of dirt that goes into Lake Tahoe stays there…making the lake less clear and blue.                                ((sot @ 4:23))                “About every year the lake will mix to a depth of about 313 meters which is kind of the average depth of Lake Tahoe. So, a 10 micron or less size particle will take almost a year to settle down to that depth, but by the time it’s settling, the lake itself is mixing and turning over. So, those particles are constantly being resuspended in the lake.                                ((Track 3)) So how do we fix the problem? Well, this type of dust and dirt comes from many sources like runoff and road dust. You don’t have to look far around Tahoe to see storm drains clogged with mud and cars kicking up dust from the road. The best way to keep this dirt and dust from getting into the lake is to control it at its source. It’s a daunting task, but something local agencies are taking-on full strength. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                                Anchor Tag: The TRPA us using a concept called source control to tackle the sediment problem Shelly just explained. All property owners at Tahoe are now required to install Best Management Practices, or BMPs on their property. BMPs are erosion control measures like storm drains and native landscaping that hold soil in place and prevents erosion.</description>

    <description>Segment 108: Permit Fees    Air Date: 3/15/05        Suggested Tease (none on tape) &quot;With building costs skyrocketing, the     cost of building at Lake Tahoe is going up even more. Shelly Purdy     explains why the TRPA is raising their permit fees coming up in the     Lake     Tahoe Report.&quot;        Anchor Intro: As of March first, the cost of filing some types of     building permits with the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is almost     double what it was before. In tonight's Lake Tahoe Report, shelly Purdy     takes a look at the fee increase and how it's supposed to help improve     customer service.        ((TAKE PKG))        ((track 1)) Depending on what type of building permit you're applying     for, it can take as long as 120 days to get that permit through the     TRPA     today.        ((sot @ 18:39, Julie Regan, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency)) &quot;People     want a faster process. People are tired of the lengthy duration of time     it takes to get through our agency, the TRPA.&quot;        ((track 2)) With such a short building season at Lake Tahoe, getting     through the permitting process quickly can mean money saved in building     and construction costs. The TRPA recognizes the need for faster     service,     so they're increasing fees to raise money to pay for more personnel and     outsourcing opportunities. Their goal is to shorten the permit process     in half from 120 days to just 60. The agency also has plans to improve     their technology.        ((sot @ 20:42)) &quot;Right now our files are still manual. We have big     unwieldly CAD drawings that are in files that are on shelves in a     warehouse or in our office. What we need to do is have those all     scanned     so they're electronic. Somebody could file their application online, or     they could access what's the status of my project online. Today, with     our system that's not possible.&quot;        ((track 3)) The TRPA employs 10 planners who review 15-1600 permit     applications every year. Their hope is by having more money available     to     hire additional personnel, the agency will be able to provide better,     faster service. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition,     I'm Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.        Anchor Tag: The TRPA governing board approved the fee increase with     conditions. The agency must show an improvement in service within 6     months or the fee increase will sunset. </description>

    <description>Segment A110: Public Opinion Survey Results    Air Date: 3/29/05        Suggested tease (none on tape): The TRPA recently surveyed 25-hundred people about what they believe should be the top priorities at Lake Tahoe. Shelly Purdy will have some of the surprising results coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report.        Anchor Intro: The various management agencies at Lake Tahoe are currently in the process of writing a resource management plan that will determine future development, conservation efforts and regulations at Tahoe for the next 20 years. These agencies recently surveyed 25-hundred people to see what their priorities are. Shelly Purdy takes a look at their answers in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.        ((TAKE PKG))        ((Track 1)) When you ask people what they love about Lake Tahoe, the answers are usually the same. They love the crystal blue water, the clean air, healthy forests and abundant recreational opportunities. And when you ask them what they believe the top priority should be in protecting Lake Tahoe…that’s an easy one too. People want to see that crystal water, fresh air and abundant forest protected. But, when you ask them what they believe the biggest threat to it all is…that’s a bit of a surprise.        ((sot @ 13:33 Julie Regan, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))    “First and foremost of concern for people was the idea of the threat of catastrophic wildfire. And certainly, we recognize no matter how much good we’ve done for Lake Tahoe over the last 10-15 years, it could all be wiped-out in the event of a catastrophic fire.”        ((track 2)) With so many devastating wildfires affecting the West in recent years, the threat to Lake Tahoe is a very real one. The fact that all the efforts currently underway to protect and preserve Lake Tahoe could be wiped-out in a single catastrophic event is not lost on the public. And it’s something local agencies here are taking very seriously.        ((sot @ 15:57))    “We want the community to be aware that we heard them loud and clear and that we’re really taking action to make sure they have a voice.”        ((track 3)) Local agencies are in the process of writing Pathway 2007…a resource management plan that will guide the way Lake Tahoe is managed over the next 20 years. Pathway 2007 will deal with fire protection and a number of other issues at Lake Tahoe including another surprising issue that came up in the survey.        ((sot @  14:49))    “People said in San Francisco, for example, when I leave the city I want to go to Tahoe and I want to see the Big Dipper. I can’t see it out of my backyard in San Francisco.”        ((track 4)) So, protecting the night sky will now be a part of Pathway 2007. Without the survey, the agencies involved in this process would never have known light pollution is an important issue to the public. It’s good to see they’re taking note of what the people really want. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.        Anchor Tag: There is still time to have your voice be heard. If you have a comment or suggestion to make about how you think Lake Tahoe should be managed over the next two decades, visit our website and look for the link to Pathway 2007.</description>

    <description>Segment A112: Tahoe Fun Facts        Air Date: April 12, 2005                Tease @ 23:42 “Did you know if you poured all the water out of Lake Tahoe over the state of California it would cover the state to a depth of 14 inches?? I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll have all the details on that and other quirky facts about Lake Tahoe coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report.”                Anchor Intro: Lake Tahoe is one of the deepest and largest fresh water lakes in the world. Most people think of Tahoe as a recreationalists paradise. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a look at some interesting facts about Tahoe that you probably didn’t know.                ((TAKE PKG))                ((track 1)) Lake Tahoe is very deep and contains an astounding amount of water. In fact, if you took all the water out of Lake Tahoe and poured it over the entire state of California, you would cover the golden state to a depth of 14 inches. And after dumping all that water out…it would take six to seven hundred years to fill back up.                ((sot @ 3:46 Bob Richards, U.C. Davis))        “It’s a very unique lake in many ways. It’s huge and very deep. It ranks about 11th in the world when you consider its volume and depth. It’s 1636 feet to the deepest point. That puts it more than 90 feet below Carson City, Nevada.”                ((track 2)) And aside from its astounding depth, Tahoe is also very cold. If you’ve ever spent some time in Tahoe’s water you know just how cold it can be.                ((sot @ 6:08))        “Tahoe is consistently cold below about four to five hundred feet. From there to the 1600 foot level it doesn’t vary more than a couple of degreed year round. The bottom of the lake is about 39 degrees farenheight. The surface can get warm and it’s nice swimming for maybe about 1-2 weeks in the summer when the temperature gets up to 70 degrees or so.”                ((Track 3)) Despite the cold temperature, there is a lot of life in Tahoe…especially at the microscopic level. There are more than 100 species of algae, 6 to 7 different kinds of plankton and as many as 15 different types of fish have been introduced to the lake over the years. But Tahoe remains what’s called a low fertility lake. That’s why the water is so crisp and clear. The challenge now is keeping it that way. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                Anchor Tag: Lake Tahoe was formed by earthquake faulting and glaciation. And, the bottom of the lake is filled with sediment. Scientists believe there is as much as 2-thousand feet of sediment piled up at the bottom of Lake Tahoe.</description>

    <description>Segment A111: Ten Things to Save Lake Tahoe    Air Date: 4/5/05        Suggested Tease (none on tape): The big agencies like the TRPA are spending millions of dollars to save Lake Tahoe. But believe it or not, there are some simple things you can do to help. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe report, Shelly Purdy will tell you ten things anyone can do to save Lake Tahoe.        Anchor Intro: The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency has a fact sheet that lists 25 ways to save Lake Tahoe. There’s a lot of good information on that fact sheet, but with the help of the experts from the TRPA, we’ve narrowed that list down to the top ten. Shelly Purdy has them all in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.        ((TAKE PKG))        ((Track 1)) Many of the items on our top ten list apply to property owners at Lake Tahoe. Since we know that soil erosion is one of the leading causes of clarity loss in the lake, keeping soil from eroding off your property is one of the best ways to help save Lake Tahoe.         ((sot @ 8:47 Julie Regan, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))    “If you’re a homeowner, you can install what are celled Best Management Practices. We call them BMPs for short. Very simple things like planting native vegetation, native drought tolerant plants..”        ((Track 2)) …The idea is to cover up bare soil. Plants hold the soil in place and keep erosion in check. Pine needles and mulches are also a great way to hold down dirt. And, if you have a dirt driveway…pave it. Believe it or not, pavement can actually be a good thing when it comes to erosion. Dirt driveways are bad because when you drive on them, you track mud and dirt onto the roadways. That dirt often ends up right in the lake.        ((sot @ 9:27))    “Also, just doing simple things about being aware of where you wash your car. How much fertilizer you p9int on your car. Again, these are things related to being a resident here.”        ((track 3)) But what if you don’t live here? And, you just like to come up and visit? There are plenty of things visitors can do to help. When you’re out hiking in the backcountry…stay on the trail. Cutting trails disturbs the soil adding to erosion. When you’re out on the water, use the local pump stations to gas-up your boat and dispose of your waste. Dumping into the lake is strictly forbidden. And when you’re out on the road, why not take the bus or ride a bike. Reducing the number of cars on the road helps alleviate congestion and helps preserve the air.        ((Sot @ 10:48))    “Every person can make a difference to help save Lake Tahoe. It won’t happen unless we as individuals work together.”        ((Track 4)) With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.        Anchor Tag: If you’d like to see the complete list of 25 things you can do to save Lake Tahoe, visit our website at kolotv.com where you’ll find a link to the TRPA’s website.</description>

I'm Shelly Purdy, coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report, I'll tell you a little about the history of Earth Day and what you can expect at this year's event.&quot;    Anchor Intro: There are a number of Earth Day events planned at Lake Tahoe and in Reno in the coming weeks. In tonight's Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a look at the history behind Earth Day and what is planned at this year's events.    TAKE PKG    ((Track 1)) This year marks the 35th anniversary of Earth Day in the United States. And, this year, Earth Day celebrations will be held on both sides of Lake Tahoe and in Reno. The South Shore event will be held this Saturday at the new Village at Heavenly. The event drew some 3 to 4-thousand people last year, and organizers are expecting an even bigger crowd this year.    ((sot @ 11:38 Jessica Schwing, Earth Day Planning Committee Chair))    &quot;We will have educational booths both on the upper and lower level. We'll also have a kids area with a lot of neat activities for kids.&quot;    ((Track 2)) There will be bands, entertainment and lots of food. But the focus of the event will be on education.    ((sot @ 12:08))    &quot;Of course, the most important part of Earth Day is we'll have all the local agencies here and non-profits out here educating us with ways to protect the Lake Tahoe environment.&quot;    ((sot @ 14:44))    &quot;What I'm hoping people come away with is an idea of maybe it's just one or two small things that they can do to take care of the environment that they live in.&quot;    ((track 4)) With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I'm shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.    Anchor Still Store: Earth Day celebrations will be held in South Lake Tahoe at the Village at Heavenly this Saturday from 11am-5pm. Another celebration will be held at the Village at Squaw Valley in North Lake Tahoe on April 30th.</description>

All of the green waste developed at this year’s Earth Day is going to be brought here to Full Circle Compost. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll tell you what it’s all about coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report.”        Anchor Intro: This year marks the 35th anniversary of Earth Day.

((TAKE PKG))        ((track 1)) These windrows are compost in the making. The rows are a mixture of manure, yard waste, wood and clay. After about ten weeks of daily turning and lots of care…the compost is ready to go back out into the garden.        ((s/u @ 24:18 Shelly Purdy)) “One of the first steps in the composting process is to chip all the large materials like wood into very fine pieces. Those fine pieces then go into the composting piles.”        ((track 2)) And, this year, all the thrown-out food and food containers generated at the two Tahoe Truckee Earth Day events will also go into the grinder.        ((sot @ 8:34 David Friedman, Nevada Division of Environmental Protection))    “In the last few years, they’ve begun to use corn as a base for making a plastic type material called PLA and this is an example of it…cups, salad bowls.”        ((track 3)) Those cups and food containers are fully compostable…which doesn’t mean they’ll be reused as cups and containers again. Rather, they’ll decompose in the composting piles and be reused in another form.        ((sot @ 17:16 Craig Witt, Full Circle Compost))    “What we’ll do is break them down using a microbial workforce. These are little single-celled organisms, predominantly aerobic organisms, that take this and disassemble it and break it back down into a substance called humus.”        ((track 4)) The compost made here at Full Circle is used mostly in local agricultural farms. It adds nutrients to the soil and keeps waste products like those cups and plastic containers from ending up in the landfill. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.        Anchor Tag: This composting program has been going at the Tahoe Truckee Earth Day events for the past two years. In that time, organizers say they have diverted some 2-thousand tons of waste from being dumped in the landfill.</description>

    <description>Segment A115: Commercial BMPs        Air Date: May 3, 2005                Tease @ 23:05 “the TRPA is rolling out a new commercial BMP program. I’m Shelly Purdy, coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report I’ll tell you what this means for commercial and industrial property owners here at Lake Tahoe.”                Anchor Intro: The term “B-M-P” is short for “Best Management Practices.” The agencies at Lake Tahoe have been requiring homeowners there to install BMPs to help improve the quality of the lake. Now, those agencies are targeting commercial property owners to do their part. Shelly Purdy explains in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((TAKE PKG))                ((track 1)) Homeowners have been asked for years to install BMPs by doing work on their property that controls erosion. Regulations at Tahoe require that every property owner does it. Up until now, the focus has been mostly on homeowners. But that’s all changing this month with a new effort to educate commercial and industrial property owners about the importance of BMPs.                ((sot @ 1:27 Birgit Widegrin, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))        “What we’re trying to say is Lake Tahoe’s clarity is everyone’s business. Urban runoff or storm water snowmelt coming off impervious surfaces such as the road in front of me, behind me as well as the businesses all contributes to the loss of clarity at Lake Tahoe.”                ((track 2)) Business owners will be sent a brochure explaining what BMPs are. They’ll be asked to contact the TRPA to get a free consultation and inspection of their property. And they may be required to do some BMP work.                ((sot @ 1:57))        “We actually have a great BMP behind me here. This whole area…many of the roads drain into these storm water detention basins and they’re also aesthetically pleasing, but they’re performing a job for us.”                ((track 3)) Most likely, the BMP work required by commercial property owners won’t be as involved as this detention basin, but some sort of erosion control could be necessary. Companies that properly install their BMPs will be recognized as a Lake Tahoe Friendly Business.                ((sot @ 3:44))        “What that means is you’ve done your part implementing your BMPs on your site and you’ve also committed to maintaining them to make sure they’ve been effective for the life of your site.”                ((track 4)) Businesses that do that will receive yearly recognition throughout the Lake Tahoe area. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                Anchor Tag: As Shelly said, BMPs are designed to control erosion. Controlling erosion is important at Lake Tahoe because it helps keep sediment and nutrients from getting into the lake. It’s that sediment and nutrients that are causing Tahoe to lose its clarity.</description>

    <description>Segment A116: Moonshine Ink    Air Date: May 10, 2005        Tease @ 20:52 “the next time you’re in Truckee be sure to pick up a copy of Moonshine Ink. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll take you inside the pages of this unique publication coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report.”        Anchor Intro: Most small towns have community newspapers. But, the Town of Truckee has two…one more mainstream publication, and another more alternative publication called Monshine Ink. The paper is wildly popular among Truckee locals. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy explains why.        ((TAKE PKG))        ((Track 1)) Anne Grogan began planning the first pages of Moonshine Ink in March of 2002. She initially thought the paper would be one 8 and a half by 11 sheet of paper. That idea has now grown into a 40 page newspaper that hits the streets monthly throughout the Truckee area.        ((s/u @ 9:48 shelly Purdy))     “Moonshine Ink has a readership of about 7,000 people which makes it a very small community paper. But the way it is printed in both English and Spanish makes it a very diverse publication for the local community.”        ((sot @ 1:58 Anne Grogan, Editor, Moonshine Ink))    “We really felt strongly that the Spanish speaking members of our community needed a source of information that’s as timely as can be considering translation needs and whatnot.”        ((track 2)) And the information and stories they translate are important to both the English and Spanish speaking members of the community. Health stories, education, housing, growth and development are all written in both English and Spanish. And one topic that’s very close to Anne Grogan’s heart: the environment. With so much going on in the Tahoe Truckee area these days, she feels it’s important for all members of the community to be well informed about the issues.        ((sot @ 3:07))    “I think that comes as much from our personal interests as what’s reflected by everyone in the community.”        ((Track 3)) Moonshine Ink is part news, part community calendar, part local newsletter. It’s target audience isn’t just one small group…it’s the entire community.        ((sot @ 7:55))    “We hear from people who run the gamut. I’ve heard from mechanics who get up in the middle of the dark…don’t come home till it’s dark….they turn on the tube, drink their beer and read Moonshine Ink cover to cover. And the attorneys read it cover to cover.”        ((track 4)) Next time you’re in Truckee, pick up a copy and see for yourself. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.        Anchor Tag: You can find Moonshine Ink at newsstands throughout town and in most stores and coffee shops.</description>

    <description>Segment A118: Contractor’s Workshop        Air Date: May 24, 2005                Tease @ 12:08        “This empty space behind me is soon going to be transformed into public space. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll tell you the work that’s going to take place here in the upcoming contractor’s workshop. That’s coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report.                Anchor intro: For the past five years, contractors who do business in the Lake Tahoe basin have been taking part in a workshop aimed at teaching them the latest techniques and technology for helping to keep Tahoe blue. Shelly Purdy takes a look at what’s planned for this year’s contractors workshop in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                ((TAKE PKG))                ((Track 1)) This year’s workshop will be held at the new North Shore Demonstration Garden located at Sierra Nevada College’s Lake Campus at Incline Village. The garden is new because it has recently been moved to this location. It may not look like much now, but during the workshop the 300 or so contractors who participate will be transforming the garden into a beautiful public space. They will be planting native vegetation, building retaining walls and installing other erosion control measures.                 ((s/u @ 11:27 Shelly Purdy))        “Believe it or not, this big pile of snow will be gone by the time the contractor’s workshop rolls around. The contractors will be working here in this spot installing several different types of materials used in driveways.”                ((sot @ 3:35 Amy Roberts, Nevada Tahoe Conservation District))        “It’s actually going to demonstrate five different types of driveway paving. So we’re going to do a couple of different types of paving stones. We’re going to do pervious concrete. We’re actually going to show a swale and a slotted trench drain in the driveway and also the infiltration system that comes off the driveway.”                ((track 2)) What’s different in this year’s workshop is the way the information will be taught. In the past, the workshop has been mainly held inside a classroom. But not this year. This year, participants will do all the work themselves…learning by doing. The information they come away with will be used on landscaping and other construction projects throughout the Tahoe Basin that are designed and built with erosion control in mind. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                Anchor Tag: This year’s Contractor’s Workshop will be held on June first.

    <description>Segment A117: Snapshot Day        Air Date: May 17, 2005                Tease @ 26:51 “With all of the research that’s being done in the Lake Tahoe Basin you might be surprised to know that streams and rivers are not monitored on a regular basis. That is the purpose of snapshot Day. I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll tell you all about this years Snapshot Day coming up on this week’s Lake Tahoe Report.                Anchor intro: The Tahoe-Truckee Clean Water Team is looking for volunteers to collect water samples at this year’s upcoming Snapshot Day. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy explains why Snapshot Day is so important to the health of Lake Tahoe and the Truckee River…and how you can get involved.                ((TAKE PKG))                ((nats – stream flowing))        ((Track 1)) It’s been a big winter, and this spring the streams and rivers around Tahoe are flowing to capacity. On May 21st, volunteers will fan out to those streams and rivers throughout the Tahoe basin and along the Truckee River to take water samples, measure flow and collect other data.                 ((s/u @ 25:44 Shelly Purdy))        “During the past few years of drought volunteers have gone to some streams during Snapshot Day that have been completely dried-up. Not this year though. This year volunteers will be taking samples during peak runoff.”                ((sot @ 19:50 Shannon Horgan, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency))        “This year in particular we’re going to hit the peak runoff. So, that’s going to be good. We’re going to get a good assessment of what is going into your streams during a heavy runoff year and be able to compare that during a light runoff year.”                ((track 2)) And, since this year marks the 5th Snapshot Day, the data collected will be compared with data from previous years to help researchers develop a trend analysis.                ((sot @ 13:31))        “What it means is you’re going back and you’re sampling each stream at ideally the same time every year, so you’re going to see hotspots that are particularly bad areas and areas that are really clean and have low levels of sediment and nutrients.”                ((track 3)) The information is used to direct additional research and funding for erosion control projects at trouble spots. The data is also being used by researchers working on Lake Tahoe’s TMDL or ‘Total Maximum Daily Load.” The TMDL is a huge study currently underway at Tahoe which will identify the major sources of pollutants in the watershed figure out a way to address the problems. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News channel 8.                Anchor Still Store: If you would like to volunteer for Snapshot Day, you can contact the Tahoe-Truckee Clean Water Team at (775) 588-4547 extension 202.   </description>

I’m Shelly Purdy, I’ll bring you inside and show you around coming up on the Lake Tahoe Report.”        Anchor Intro: Wildlife Shelter, Inc. is a non-profit animal rehabilitation facility located in Homewood on the west shore of Lake Tahoe. Over the past 20 years, the facility has treated more than 8-thousand animals and birds. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy explains what the shelter is all about.        ((TAKE PKG))        ((track 1)) Every days is a busy day at Wildlife Shelter, Inc. There are animals and birds that need tending, lots of mouths to feed and plenty of cages to clean. In the owl shelter outside, two great horned owls curiously survey their surroundings. These owls came to the shelter as babies. They were injured after falling out of a tree. The goal of the shelter is to care for their injuries and release them back into the wild.        ((sot @ 15:29 Connie Stevens, Wildlife Shelter, Inc.))    “There is one that is extremely wild that has nothing to do with humans…won’t talk to us at all which is wonderful. We like that and that one will be very much releasable.”        ((track 2)) The shelter also houses a raccoon that was hit by a car and has a broken leg, a snake with a broken jaw, several birds with broken wings and other assorted patients. The shelter also raises its own food including mice and rats and even beetle larvae. There is no paid staff at Wildlife Shelter, Inc. Instead, a group of dedicated volunteers keeps the place going. And, there is one common belief they all share.        ((sot @ 22:44))    “Being respectful to all life is a very important theme that we live by here at Wildlife Shelter, Inc.”        ((track 3)) Animals and birds come to the shelter from all over northern California and northwestern Nevada. They come because they are injured or hurt in some way. The shelter takes them in, patches them up and when they’re ready, sets them free.        ((sot @ 18:34))    “All of our patients have to pass a test and the test if four points. One, can it see and recognize its normal diet. And, two, can it get to it and consume that food. Question three is does it recognize danger, and four can it escape from that danger.”        ((track 4)) If an animal can meet all four requirements, it is released back into the wild. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.        Anchor Tag: During the summertime, Wildlife Shelter, Inc sees more than 100 patients every day. Their best advice if you happen upon an injured animal…cover its head and body with a blanket or towel and move it into an enclosed space. Then call a professional for help.</description>

    <description>Segment A121: South Lake Tahoe Refuse        Air Date: 6/14/05                Suggested Tease: There is no curbside recycling in South Lake Tahoe, yet their local refuse company recycles 40-percent of the waste they collect. Shelly Purdy will tell us how they do it in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.                Anchor Intro: We are lucky here in Washoe County to have a curbside recycling program. But despite the fact that it’s simple and easy to do, only about 27-percent of the waste generated in Washoe County gets recycled. Compare that to South Lake Tahoe. They recycle 40-percent. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy tells us how they do it.                ((TAKE PKG))                ((nats – tractor pushing garbage))                ((track 1)) South Lake Tahoe generates about 100-thousand tons of garbage every year. 40-thousand of it gets recycled, and 60-thousand goes to the landfill. There is no curbside recycling in South Lake Tahoe, so how do they do it?? They sort it and recycle it themselves here at the South Lake Tahoe Refuse Company.                ((sot @ 1:48, Jeanne Lear, South Lake Tahoe Refuse Company))        “The materials goes on a conveyor line. The conveyor comes up to a second story and various employees at different stations pull different types of materials.”                ((track 2)) First the big stuff like cardboard and newspaper is taken out. Then, plastic and aluminum cans are sorted and taken out. Lastly, glass is removed leaving the rest of the garbage to be taken to the landfill. There are several reasons why South Lake Tahoe doesn’t have a curbside recycling program. During the wintertime, there is snow to deal with. During the summertime, wildlife can be a problem. And, there are all the hotels and rental properties in the area. Getting tourists to recycle and put their bins out on the curb has proven to be a losing proposition.                ((sot @ 4:33))        “Since our waste stream is about 60% commercial and 40% residential and since a great volume of what we get comes from resort properties, we’ve come up with a plan of bringing it in and sorting it ourselves as opposed to a curbside recycling plan.”                ((track 3)) And it’s a plan that is working. The South Tahoe Refuse Company will expand their facility over the next several years so they can take-in and recycle even more material. Their long-term goal is to recycle 100-percent of what comes in. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.                Anchor Tag: Though the workers at South Tahoe Refuse admit sorting other people’s garbage is not a glamorous job, they take great pride in the work they’re doing. In the seven years the facility has been in operation, they’ve had a very low turnover rate in their workforce.</description>

    <description>Segment 122: &quot;Lahontan Cutthroat Trout at Fallen Leaf Lake&quot; (Air Date : 4/21/2005). Brant Allen from the Tahoe Environmental Research Center discusses the work being done to repopulate the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout.    Tease @ 14:58 “Rivers and streams in the Lake Tahoe area are running very fast and very cold this time of year. I’m Shelly Purdy, coming up in this week’s Lake Tahoe report, I’ll tell you what this guy is doing snorkeling in these frigid waters.”        Anchor intro: In the past three years, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has stocked 70-thousand Lahontan Cutthroat Trout at Fallen Leaf Lake, which is located on the western side of Lake Tahoe. The goal is to re-establish the now extinct fish as a self-sustaining population in the lake. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a look at how their efforts are going.        TAKE PKG        ((nats – Brant Allen in river))    ((Track 1)) The best way to count how the stocked fish are doing in Fallen Leaf Lake is to count them as they come up to spawn in Glen Alpine Creek. We’re told it’s a bit like rock climbing on a horizontal waterfall in very cold water, but it’s a task that must be done.        ((s/u@ 16:01 shelly Purdy))    “Researcher Brant Allen has been out here regularly since April counting all the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout as they come upstream to spawn.”        ((sot @ 2:19 Brant Allen, Tahoe Environmental Research Center))    “The fish that we’re seeing in the stream now are the largest fish that were planted in the first plant in 2002 as well as many of the fish planted in 203. They’ve survived out in the lake and have been able to gain enough food energy from feeding in the lake that they can now reproduce and they’re coming up in the stream to do so.”        ((track 2)) The Lahontan Cutthroat Trout was the native game fish originally found at Fallen Leaf Lake and Lake Tahoe. The last fish was caught here at Fallen Leaf in the mid-1930s. The long-term goal now is to re-build a self -sustaining population in the lake.        (sot @ 3:47))    “The lake has been manipulated with so many different species that it’s really a different system than it was initially. So, we’re looking now to see how do they fit in to that new system in the lake and can they survive in it. And, apparently based on what we’re seeing is they do quite well.”        ((Track 3)) Though the numbers of fish Brant Allen is seeing in the creek aren’t huge, he is encouraged by the fact that he is seeing healthy Lahontan Cutthroat Trout swimming upstream to spawn. Those are the fish at the top of their gene pool since they’ve figured out how to survive and thrive in Fallen Leaf Lake. Researchers hope it’s these fish that eventually repopulate Fallen Leaf. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m shelly Purdy for KOLO news Channel 8.        Anchor Tag: The Lahontan Cutthroat Trout swim upstream into Glen Alpine Creek in late April and early May to lay their eggs. The eggs will hatch in mid July and the fingerlings will swim back out into the lake to hopefully grow into adulthood. When those fish are three to four years old, they will make their way up the creek to spawn for the first time.</description>

    <description>Segment A123: Sugar Pine Foundation    Air Date: June 28, 2005        Tease @ 20:01 “You might recognize this massive cone as belonging to the sugar pine. But something is threatening the sugar pine in the Tahoe Basin. I’m Shelly Purdy, coming up on the Lake Tahoe report, I’ll tell you about the white pine blister rust.”        Anchor intro: A deadly fungus is spreading through the forests of the Tahoe Basin and the Sierra affecting six different types of pine tree species. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a look at this fungus and what’s being done to keep trees alive.        ((TAKE PKG))        ((track 1)) It’s called the white pine blister rust. And it has a unique relationship with pine trees. The fungus grows and develops on gooseberry and currant plants. In the fall, if conditions are right, the spores from the fungus become airborne and infect nearby pine trees.         ((sot @ 8:38 John Pickett, Sugar pine Foundation))    “The fungus forms a canker which is like a cancer if you were thinking about a person that grows perennially on this tree. And, that canker will eventually enlarge every year until finally it gets in the trunk of the tree.”        ((s/u @ 22:15 shelly Purdy))    “The telltale signs that a tree is infected is one dead branch. If there’s only one dead branch in the tree, you still have time to save it.”        ((track 2)) The solution is to simply prune the infected branch off the tree. Since weather conditions that allow the spores to spread only happen about once every ten years, pruning is a good option for many homeowners.        ((sot @ 9:30 John Pickett, Sugar Pine Foundation)    “If they can get the canker before it’s within 6 inches of the trunk of the tree then we have a very good change of saving the tree form that individual canker.”        ((Track 3)) Though pruning can work for individual trees, what do you do about an entire forest? The Sugar Pine Foundation is currently working on a solution that uses the genetics from trees with a natural resistance.         ((sot @ 11:15))    “We’re going to be sharing genetics from all around the Truckee/Tahoe area from Sierraville all the way down to Markleeville and we’ll be using seeds from different areas of the lake to keep the genetic diversity high in each of our locations around the lake.”        ((track 4)) The foundation is working to secure enough funding to plant seedlings throughout the Tahoe Basin. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News Channel 8.        Anchor tag: Some of the species that the White Pine Blister Rust affects include the majestic Sugar Pine, the Western White Pine and the Bristlecone Pine.</description>

    <description>Segment A124: Eurasian Water Milfoil    Air Date: July 5, 2005        Suggested Tease: An invasive water plant called the Eurasian Water Milfoil has taken root in Lake Tahoe and is spreading rapidly. Shelly Purdy takes a look at the effect this non-native plant is having in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.        Anchor Intro: As it’s name suggests, the Eurasian Water Milfoil comes from Europe and Asia. The plant can now be found in just about every marina at Lake Tahoe. In tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a look at why the spread of this non-native species is cause for concern.        ((TAKE PKG))        ((Track 1)) Researchers believe Eurasian Water Milfoil was introduced to Lake Tahoe at the Tahoe Keys…probably brought here unwittingly by a boater. Pieces of the plant get caught in propellers, and those pieces fall off and grow into new plants. That’s what’s happened at the Tahoe Keys. The infestation here is so bad the local homeowner’s association actually has to mow the plant to keep the waterways open. With how easily Eurasian Water Milfoil spreads, is no surprise the plant can now be found throughout the lake – and can easily be spotted at other Tahoe marinas.        ((sot @ 1:01 Lars Anderson, PhD, U.S. Department of Agriculture))    “We’ve watched the EWM spread from the keys to probably a dozen different locations – small marinas- in the lake. So, we’re concerned about it’s continuous spread and the fact that we really can’t do anything about it at this point.”        ((Track 2)) Eurasian Water Milfoil has no native competition in Lake Tahoe. The plant loves cold water and easily spreads. It gets so dense that it pushes out the native species of plants. And that is causing great concern among researchers here at Tahoe.        ((Sot @ 3:13))    “The reason that’s important is those native plants have certain characteristics for water fowl and fish habitat. And once this plant takes over those habitats can really change. So it can really reduce habitat for native waterfowl and fish that we have.”        ((track 3)) To help combat further spread of the plant and to keep it from being taken from Tahoe into other waterways… new warning signs are being put up at Lake Tahoe marinas to warn boaters. They’re asking boaters to clean the plant parts off their boats before entering or exiting the lake. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News channel 8.        Anchor Tag: If the rapid spread with Eurasian Water Milfoil wasn’t bad enough, researchers recently discovered another invasive non-native plant at Lake Tahoe. The Curly Leaf Pond Weed likes the same type of habitat as the Water Milfoil…and is actually spreading faster.</description>

    <description>Segment 126: Fault Zones	    Air Date: July 19, 2005        Suggested Tease: The ground has been shaking up in the Lake Tahoe area. As it turns out, large quakes near Lake Tahoe aren’t all that unusual. Shelly Purdy takes a look at the many faults that crisscross the lake coming up in this week’s Lake Tahoe Report.        Anchor Intro: When a 4.8 (??check final magnitude) magnitude earthquake rocked the north shore of Lake Tahoe last month, it got a lot of people talking. Come to find out, Tahoe has many earthquake faults that run through and around the lake. Shelly Purdy takes a look in tonight’s Lake Tahoe Report.        ((TAKE PKG))        ((track 1)) The earthquake was centered near Truckee about 3 miles east of the Truckee airport. In the past 6 years, there have been three large quakes in that same area, leading geologists to recognize that it is a very seismically active region.         ((sot @ 8:06 Richard Schweickert, Ph.D., UNR Geology Professor))    “We don’t have an explanation of why there is a fair amount of seismicity up in this area where the faults are poorly known and there doesn’t seem to be much activity in the lake where the faults are much more obvious.”        ((track 2)) The faults that run through and around Lake Tahoe are so well documented thanks to the efforts of a small group of UNR researchers.         ((sot @ 8:48))    “We’ve spent a great deal of time hiking all the mountains, hiking all the canyons, going through all the dense brush. Of course, driving all the mountain roads, and looking at all the various rocks that occur and looking at the landscape and seeing where there are breaks in the land’s surface.”        ((Track 3)) When they began mapping Tahoe’s faults about 10 years ago. The researchers didn’t think they’d find all that many. In the past decade, they have successfully mapped several undiscovered faults and believe there are many others yet to be found.        ((sot @ 11:20)) “In many places you can walk along a hillside and see a very smooth land surface and has a very uniform slope and then suddenly it will step down. Maybe it’ll step down three feet. Maybe 30 feet and then the land surface will continue. So, when you see that large step you can follow it out as a long linear trace and that’s usually what marks a fault.        ((track 4)) Mapping earthquake faults is a time-consuming process, but an important one. Knowing where earthquake faults are helps planners be prepared for possible geologic hazards in a region.  With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News channel 8.        Anchor Tag: The earthquake last month near Truckee happened in an area of private property where researchers have been denied access to map the fault lines.</description>

    <description>Segment 125: Fire/BMP Program	        Air Date: July 12, 2005                Suggested Tease: There is help out there for people who live at Lake Tahoe and are concerned about the threat of wildfire. In this week’s Lake Tahoe Report, Shelly Purdy takes a look at an upcoming series of events aimed at teaching the public about living with fire.                Anchor Intro: The Parasol Community Collaboration based at Incline Village is hosting a public workshop this week titled “Living at Tahoe – protecting your property.” As Shelly Purdy explains in this week’s Lake Tahoe Report, it is a series of events designed to help residents and others learn to deal with the threat of wildfire.                ((TAKE PKG))                ((Track 1)) You ask any fire manager about the threat of a major wildfire in the Tahoe Basin and they’ll tell you it’s not a question of if, but when it will happen. That’s why it’s so important for property owners here to create defensible space around their homes. But, in the Tahoe Basin, creating defensible space also means taking water quality into consideration. That’s why local fire agencies have teamed up with local resource management agencies to present a workshop about Living at Tahoe.                 ((sot @ 1:11 Tia Rancourt, North Lake Tahoe fire Protection District))        “We’re going to kick-off the event on the 13th at the movie theater. We’re going to show ‘Living with Fire’.”                ((Track 2)) Living with Fire is a movie produced by the UNR Cooperative Extension. It talks about defensible space and how to protect your home in the event of a wildfire. Representatives from the forest service, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the fire department will be on-hand after the movie to answer questions.                 ((sot @ 2:13))        “We’re doing this to increase awareness and to get people to think about performing defensible space around their homes.”                ((Track 3)) In a major wildfire, having defensible space could make the difference whether a home survives or not. With the Lake Tahoe Environmental Education Coalition, I’m Shelly Purdy for KOLO News channel 8.                Anchor Tag: The movie “Living with Fire” will be shown at the Incline Theater on July 13th. Other events that will highlight conservation and erosion control will take place on the 14th and 15th.     </description>

    <description>March 24, 1877.  MINING AND SCIENTIFIC PRESS  185      Comstock Papers.—No. 20.      Filling Up the Geographical Vocabulary of the Country.      How rapidly a mining excitement, through a hastened influx of population, tends to multiply the names of natural objects and localities in a country before almost without any geographica-vocabulary, the movement caused by the discovery of the Comstock lode aptly illustrates.  Take any map of the region now constituting the State of Nevada, published prior to 1860, and we find it well nigh a blank.  Scarcely more than 50 names, all told, appear upon it. The few mountain ranges, scattered at random over it, leave us to infer that the country is an almost uninterrupted plain, a supposition strengthened by the fact that it really does form a part of the Utah basin or Great American desert.  The only rivers laid down are the Humboldt, Truckee, Carson and the Walker with their several forks in the northwest and the Rio Virgin and the Muddy in the southeast, these being, in truth, all the streams that exist here of sufficient size to be styled rivers. We see thereon the names of some half dozen lakes and sinks and sloughs.  Dotted lines, devious and far separated, straggle across the nameless waste, indicating the trails of Fremont, Beckl with, Steptoe and other early explorers, while a single wagon road, coming in from the northeast, and following down the Humboldt, marks the route pursued by the pioneer immigration.  Here and there is put down on these early maps a saline or thermal spring, a mud lake or a soda lagoon, the only towns or settlements appearing thereon, being the old Mormon station, now Genoa, Franktown, in Washoe valley, Ragtown, standing near Carson river, on the southerly edge of the Forty-Mile desert and Chinatown, situate at the junction of Gold Canyon and Carson river, near the point where the old immigrant road crosses the latter.  Upon these early and almost vacant charts, are put down neither townships, counties, nor other political divisions; all that is indicated in this direction being that the country belonged to Utah territory, being generally denominated Western Utah.      Progress of the Work      If now we look upon the map of this region, 18 years ago so nearly a blank, we find it crowded with names.  First, we have the Territory as an entirety organized into the State of Nevada with fourteen counties, some of which have been in part subdivided into townships.  A multitude of mining districts appear, covering a large portion of the State, being those that still maintain their organization, such as were formed and afterwards disbanded through diminished population, or, as sometimes happened, through entire desertion, having been dropped from the more recent maps.  Scores of towns and mining camps present themselves, some of the former being of very respectable dimensions, both as regards business and population; Virginia City and Gold Hill, which are really but one place, containing about 25,000 inhabitants, while Carson City has over 5,000.  Such additional lakes and streams as have since been discovered, as well also as the principal mountain ranges and passes, the more noteworthy springs, the borax beds and other remarkable salines have all been looked after and duly named.      Scanty Material.      In this christening process the Washoe argonauts have had to rely mainly upon their own linguistic resources, there having been here no previously existing Spanish and but a scanty Indian nomenclature, as in California, to help them out.  There were, to be sure, names of aboriginal origin attached to some of the higher peaks and ranges, and also to a few other of the more remarkable natural objects, but the adoption of these, except in a few instances, was by the whites deemed inexpedient because of their great length, their harsh and guttural sounds or their awkward pronunciation.  The Rio Virgin (already half anglicized), a small stream in the southeastern part of the State, and Las Vegas, meaning the meadows, in the same vicinity, appear to have been the only terms derived from the Spanish to be found on the early maps of all this region, the christening of these having been due to their lying along the old trail leading from Santa Fe to Los Angeles, and not because there had ever been settlements made here by that people.      Of the Indian Names that Have Been Retained.      We have, first, Tahoe, applied to the large lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains, about two-thirds of it being in the State of  California.  The term, in the native tongue, means big or beautiful water, and adhering to the Indian rule should be divided into three syllables and pronounced Tah-hoe-ee, with the accent on the last, and not in two syllables, with the accent on the first, as we absurdly practice.  The observance of the method first mentioned besides being more in consonance with the analogy of the aboriginal tongue, would impart to the word a much more poetic and euphonious sound.  The newspaper press should attend to the correction of this mistake.  Washoe, the name of an Indian tribe who formerly inhabited a series of valleys lying along the eastern base of the Sierra, is still retained, having been given to the principal valley in this series and also to the county which covers it, and the country adjacent.  This term should have been applied to the State itself in accordance with the desire of many of the inhabitants at the time of its creation, as it had already become identified with the famous silver mines all over the world, and its adoption, apart from its eminent fitness and agreeable sound, would have prevented the many mistakes that constantly occur through the confounding of this name and that of the large and populous California county adjoining this State on the west.  The Truckee river was so called after the Indian who was employed by the Donner party to guide them over the mountains into California.  He appears to have been a faithful and intelligent old man, and there is little doubt but these unfortunate people would have escaped the terrible fate that overtook them, had they paid attention to his timely warnings.  Shoshone, Toiyabe and Toquima, names of three high mountain ranges in Nye county, are all of Indian origin; so also is Sinkavata, a broad valley lying to the west of the Shoshone range; Winnemucca, name of a town on the Central Pacific railroad, also of a shallow lake lying to the east of Pyramid lake, and connected with it by a slough, was the name of the principal chief of the Paiutes, who lived to a great age, dying only a few years since, leaving a son who, succeeding to his name and office and who has, like his father, always maintained friendly relations with the whites.  Pahranagut is the name of a mining district situate in Lincoln county, in the extreme southeastern part of the State.  It once contained quite a large population and enjoyed a good reputation for mineral wealth, but failing to sustain it by practical results the place has, for years past, been nearly abandoned.      Having but a meager vocabulary upon which to draw, the early dwellers on the &quot;Eastern slope&quot; being those of the pre-Comstock era, managed to make this slender stock go a good way.  Thus, the name of Kit Carson, the famous Indian scout and guide, was by them applied to a river, the pass in which that stream originated, the valley through which it ran, as well as to the lake into which it disembogued and the sink where the surplus waters of the latter finally disappeared; the name having at a later date been given to a county organized in this part of Utah, and afterwards also to a city, the now flourishing capital of Nevada.      Among the county names of the new State only that of Washoe is of Indian origin.  Esmeralda county was called after the principal mining district within its limits.  The term, meaning in Spanish an emerald, was in its application here a purely fanciful and not altogether happy one.  Douglas county was named after Stephen A. Douglas, then United States Senator from Illinois.  Ormsby, after Major Ormsby, an early settler in Carson valley and an energetic business man, who was killed while leading the expedition against the Indians in June, 1860.  Storey in like manner was named after Captain Storey, who lost his life in the same expedition.  Lyon was named in honor of General Lyon, a brave officer in the Union army, who fell at the battle of Wilson's creek, Missouri, in 1861. Churchill county was also named after a distinguished army officer, his name having before this been given to the fort, erected on Carson river in 1860. Humboldt county bears the name of Baron Von Humboldt, the great German scientist, traveler and author.  Eureka and Elko were named after the principal towns they contain.  Nye county was named after James W. Nye, first Governor of the Territory and afterwards U. S. Senator from Nevada, an honor that he well deserved.  Lander after General Lander, of the U. S. army, who for many years was engaged in exploring the country between the Missouri river and California, and laying out wagon roads through the same.  Lincoln county was named after the &quot;martyr&quot; President, and White Pine after the chief mining district of that region, the name having been originally suggested by a species of pine found in the neighborhood.      The towns and stations along the Central Pacific railroad were mostly named by the company; some, as Reno, Halleck and Wadsworth, after military men; others, as White Plains, Rye Patch, Wells, Palisade and Promontory, etc., from certain natural features or peculiarities of the place; while the choice of others, like Verdi, Vista, Toano, etc., was mere matter of fancy or taste.  Mill City was a name applied to that site, now a railroad station, long before the road itself was built, it having been selected under the impression that the canal projected for taking water from the Humboldt and conducting it to this point, would lead to the erection here of many mills for the purposes of ore reduction.  The  ditch never having been completed the mills failed, and as a consequence, the town also failed to be built.      The Twin Rivers.      When Fremont crossed this country in his expedition of 1845, he was led to notice while passing through Big Smoky valley two large streams of the purest water, issuing each from a narrow gate-like gorge in the Toiyabe range.  These gorges are but a few hundred yards apart and the two streams continuing to flow out into the valley in close proximity and parallel to each other for quite a distance, suggested the name of &quot;Twin rivers,&quot; which was accordingly given to them by the great &quot;Path-finder,&quot; and they were so laid down in the maps afterwards prepared by him.  When the inevitable prospector arrived in that region, recognizing in these two creeks the Twin rivers of Fremont, he adopted the name for a mining district, whence it came to be applied to a considerable section of the mountains and valley adjacent; the singular form of the phrase, &quot;Twin River,&quot; having meantime come into general use.      Reese  River      Was named after Captain Reese, a Mormon, who having a home establishment at both Carson valley and Salt Lake, necessitating frequent journeys between these two points, was led to seek a shorter path than the circuitous route via the valley of the Humboldt.  In carrying out this purpose he left the old immigrant road near Carson lake, and pursuing an easterly course came upon the small stream that now bears his name.  Walker river and lake bear the name of one of the employees of the Northwestern Fur Co., who trapped on these waters many years ago.  Pyramid lake is so called because of a high, conical rock rising from the deep water near its eastern shore. In looking over the modern map of Nevada, many streams will be seen there laid down as rivers, but they are with the exceptions already noticed, nothing but creeks, and the most of these very small creeks at that. Reese, Twin, White and many other so-called rivers, including the Virgin and the Muddy, are everywhere easily fordable, nor would it greatly trouble an active man to jump across almost any of them, except during their highest stages.                  Ruffed Grouse.      --------------      The bird of which we give an engraving on this page will be recognized by our Oregon and Northern California readers as a denizen of their thickets. Many others will also remember it the object of their gunning in the Eastern States.  The grouse, although one of the most widely distributed birds in the United States, seldom, if ever, so far as we know, appears in our Southern counties.  It is known as the &quot;partridge&quot; in the Middle States and the &quot;pheasant&quot; in the Southern States.      There is a close resemblance between this bird and the domestic fowl in their natural habits, especially with respect to the rearing of their young.      Although a permanent resident in the region it inhabits, the ruffed grouse performs partial sorties at the approach of autumn, but not so extensive as the peregrinations of the wild turkey, the little partridge or the primated grouse, yet sufficiently so to be noticeable at periods when the food in some mountainous localities becomes scarce.      Although the ruffed grouse is partial to the craggy sides of mountains and hills and the rocky borders of rivers and small streams, thickly mantled with evergreen, small trees and shrubs, they at times remove to low lands, and even enter the thickest cane-brakes, where they sometimes breed.  In the spring and autumn the male often betrays himself to the gunner by a drumming noise produced by his wings, which they have been known to continue for several hours at a time, and may sometimes be heard at a distance of half a mile. Their human persecutors imitate this noise, by taping on dry and inflated adders, when the bird comes forth to combat a supposed rival, and is shot; and they are also caught in traps set upon their drumming ground, or logs.  Different species of hawks also destroy them, particularly the red-tailed and Cooper's hawks.  Skunks, weasels, raccoons, opossums, and foxes are also their foes, some of them sucking their eggs, and others feeding on their flesh.      Seeds and berries of all kinds chiefly comprise their food, but they are particularly fond of fox-grapes, winter-grapes, strawberries and dew-berries. In winter or early spring, they eat the tender buds of various trees, and thus sometimes prove injurious to the apple and other fruit crops located near dense woods. They are then easily approached, but are too lean to be desired. About the first of September, when the mountains are covered with whortleberries and blackberries, is the proper time for shooting and catching them. Trap-boxes are then used, as well as the &quot;figure-of-four.&quot; When the snow is deep, they often conceal themselves by diving beneath it and emerging at a distant place, but are often caught in the attempt.      The whirring noise produced by these birds when rising in alarm from the ground is not made at any other time.  Its usual flight is low, straight forward, and seldom more than a few hundred yards at a time, being also stiff, and accompanied with a beating of the wings for more than half the distance, after which, it sails like a ship before the wind. It moves gracefully and proudly upon the ground, until alarmed, when it lowers its head, expands its tail, first runs a little distance, and then flies away with a whirring noise.                  Air Compressors.            We are asked by a correspondent what air compressor received the highest award at the Centennial. The awards for air compressors have not yet been received from the judges by the competitors, although the Burleigh Drill Company received notice that they had obtained an award on the air compressor as they did on the drilling machinery. As soon as the report of the judges is received we will publish it for the information of our mining readers.      Rumors of a compromise between the Richmond and Eureka Con. companies are in circulation at Eureka. The Sentinel has not been able to find any foundation for them.      We can recommend the New York watch, of Springfield, Mass., as A. 1.</description>

These gorges are but a few hundred yards apart and the two streams continuing to flow out into the valley in close proximity and parallel to each other for quite a distance, suggested the name of  Twin rivers,  which was accordingly given to them by the great  Path-finder,  and they were so laid down in the maps afterwards prepared by him.  When the inevitable prospector arrived in that region, recognizing in these two creeks the Twin rivers of Fremont, he adopted the name for a mining district, whence it came to be applied to a considerable section of the mountains and valley adjacent; the singular form of the phrase,  Twin River,  having meantime come into general use.   Reese  River   Was named after Captain Reese, a Mormon, who having a home establishment at both Carson valley and Salt Lake, necessitating frequent journeys between these two points, was led to seek a shorter path than the circuitous route via the valley of the Humboldt.  In carrying out this purpose he left the old immigrant road near Carson lake, and pursuing an easterly course came upon the small stream that now bears his name.  Walker river and lake bear the name of one of the employees of the Northwestern Fur Co., who trapped on these waters many years ago.  Pyramid lake is so called because of a high, conical rock rising from the deep water near its eastern shore. In looking over the modern map of Nevada, many streams will be seen there laid down as rivers, but they are with the exceptions already noticed, nothing but creeks, and the most of these very small creeks at that. Reese, Twin, White and many other so-called rivers, including the Virgin and the Muddy, are everywhere easily fordable, nor would it greatly trouble an active man to jump across almost any of them, except during their highest stages.         Ruffed Grouse.   --------------   The bird of which we give an engraving on this page will be recognized by our Oregon and Northern California readers as a denizen of their thickets. Many others will also remember it the object of their gunning in the Eastern States.  The grouse, although one of the most widely distributed birds in the United States, seldom, if ever, so far as we know, appears in our Southern counties.  It is known as the  partridge  in the Middle States and the  pheasant  in the Southern States.   There is a close resemblance between this bird and the domestic fowl in their natural habits, especially with respect to the rearing of their young.   Although a permanent resident in the region it inhabits, the ruffed grouse performs partial sorties at the approach of autumn, but not so extensive as the peregrinations of the wild turkey, the little partridge or the primated grouse, yet sufficiently so to be noticeable at periods when the food in some mountainous localities becomes scarce.   Although the ruffed grouse is partial to the craggy sides of mountains and hills and the rocky borders of rivers and small streams, thickly mantled with evergreen, small trees and shrubs, they at times remove to low lands, and even enter the thickest cane-brakes, where they sometimes breed.  In the spring and autumn the male often betrays himself to the gunner by a drumming noise produced by his wings, which they have been known to continue for several hours at a time, and may sometimes be heard at a distance of half a mile. Their human persecutors imitate this noise, by taping on dry and inflated adders, when the bird comes forth to combat a supposed rival, and is shot; and they are also caught in traps set upon their drumming ground, or logs.  Different species of hawks also destroy them, particularly the red-tailed and Cooper's hawks.  Skunks, weasels, raccoons, opossums, and foxes are also their foes, some of them sucking their eggs, and others feeding on their flesh.   Seeds and berries of all kinds chiefly comprise their food, but they are particularly fond of fox-grapes, winter-grapes, strawberries and dew-berries. In winter or early spring, they eat the tender buds of various trees, and thus sometimes prove injurious to the apple and other fruit crops located near dense woods. They are then easily approached, but are too lean to be desired. About the first of September, when the mountains are covered with whortleberries and blackberries, is the proper time for shooting and catching them. Trap-boxes are then used, as well as the  figure-of-four.  When the snow is deep, they often conceal themselves by diving beneath it and emerging at a distant place, but are often caught in the attempt.   The whirring noise produced by these birds when rising in alarm from the ground is not made at any other time.  Its usual flight is low, straight forward, and seldom more than a few hundred yards at a time, being also stiff, and accompanied with a beating of the wings for more than half the distance, after which, it sails like a ship before the wind. It moves gracefully and proudly upon the ground, until alarmed, when it lowers its head, expands its tail, first runs a little distance, and then flies away with a whirring noise.         Air Compressors.      We are asked by a correspondent what air compressor received the highest award at the Centennial. The awards for air compressors have not yet been received from the judges by the competitors, although the Burleigh Drill Company received notice that they had obtained an award on the air compressor as they did on the drilling machinery. As soon as the report of the judges is received we will publish it for the information of our mining readers.   Rumors of a compromise between the Richmond and Eureka Con. companies are in circulation at Eureka. The Sentinel has not been able to find any foundation for them.   We can recommend the New York watch, of Springfield, Mass., as A. 1.

    <description>Segment 130 - New Science Center Air Date: August 8, 2005  The cornerstone of the new Tahoe Center for Environmental Sciences will be laid in a public ceremony, 4 – 7 p.m., Aug. 20, on the Lake Campus of Sierra Nevada College, at the corner of state Route 28 and Country Club Drive in Incline Village. This will complete the foundation for the new world-class hub of research and teaching on the preservation of alpine lakes.  Top officials from California and Nevada and the states' universities will lead the public celebration and ceremony, Foundation for the Future. The public is welcome at the ceremony and celebration reception.  U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn; U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.; UC Davis Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef; and Sierra Nevada College President Paul Ranslow will lead the ceremony. Other officials taking part include representatives from the Desert Research Institute; University of Nevada, Reno; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; RAND Corporation; and Carnegie-Mellon University.  At the reception immediately following the ceremony, in the Prim Library, attendees will have the opportunity to meet the scientists and project partners, and learn about the research, academic initiatives, scientific exhibits and educational programs that will take place at the facility. Poster exhibits will explain recent research advances on Tahoe issues such as forest health, biodiversity, air quality, water quality, earthquake faults and the reintroduction of Lahontan Cutthroat Trout to Fallen Leaf Lake.  Guests will be able to take a virtual tour of the building from the architects via an amazing animated DVD rendering of the building, both inside and out. They will also be able to learn about the innovative green technology used in this start-of-the-art building, which employs energy-efficient and sustainable design features that will enhance the health and productivity of the scientists and students who work there.  The center is a national model for multi-institutional collaboration and green building technology. The ambitious project is supported by federal, state, private and foundation funding.  Under development for a decade, the new facility will be an international leader for science and teaching on the preservation of alpine lakes and their watersheds. It will house offices and research labs for the Tahoe Environmental Research Center of UC Davis, classrooms and labs for the students of Sierra Nevada College, the Thomas J. Long Center for environmental information, and exhibits open to the public on the ground floor. The building is scheduled for completion in August 2006.  On Aug. 21, at Commons Beach in Tahoe City, many of these same dignitaries will assemble for the 2005 Lake Tahoe Environmental Forum. Since the Presidential Forum in 1997, this event has become an important yearly gathering of federal, state and local leaders dedicated to preserving Lake Tahoe. Invited guests will hear progress reports on water quality, planning activities, and wildfire protection from federal, state and local agencies.</description>

    <description>Segment 131 - Old Fish Hatchery Renovation Planned Air Date: August 22, 2005  The old fish hatchery just outside of Tahoe City will soon be getting some much-needed tender loving care. This historic building, built in 1921, was used to raise coldwater fish, such as trout. There is only one other similar building, designed by the same State of California architect, in existence. The building was designed to keep the temperature cold enough for the coldwater fish. After new methods were developed for providing cold groundwater for the juvenile fish, the high-altitude hatchery became obsolete.  The University of California, Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center (formerly called the Tahoe Research Group) has been conducting research out of this old fish hatchery for the past 20 years. The structure is now in a state of disrepair. A group of scientific research institutions is building a new state-of-the-art facility on the Sierra Nevada College Campus at Incline Village. However, UC Davis is also planning to renovate the old hatchery.  Most visitors and many locals might not even be aware that there is an old historic fish hatchery in the region. The hatchery was once home to John Steinbeck, who actually wrote his first novel here.  “Since UC Davis began operating out of this building it has been maintained just with a small amount of funding that we could get from research grants. As you can see from the roof, that hasn’t been enough to make it the establishment we would like it to be,” says Geoff Schladow, director, UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center.  Reno architectural firm Lundahl and Associates, along with a full team of historical architects, structural engineers, mechanical engineers and others, have been hired to come up with a renovation plan. Inside, the original scissor beams will be preserved and repaired. The rest of the inside will be gutted.  “This hatchery will provide a field station and prep lab. When we have a large lake experiment going on and we are starting to prepare equipment to go out into the lake for months at a time, this open space allows us to assemble the large equipment,” Schladow explains. On the outside, the building will get a new roof, new siding and new windows. Since it is a historical building, the character and history of the hatchery will be preserved. There are also plans for an interpretive boardwalk through the nearby wetland and an annex to the building that will be open to the public.  There will be static display boards and a window to the inside so that people can see the old architecture. “If there are activities going on, preparing for an experiment, people can come see what’s involved in doing this kind of research,” Schladow says.  Construction is expected to begin as early as next spring. There are also plans to coordinate with other nearby Placer County and California Tahoe Conservancy wetland restoration projects.</description>

    <description>Segment 132 -  NASA Satellites Rely on Tahoe Buoys for Validation Air Date : August 29, 2005   Scientists from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and University of California, Davis have placed a network of research buoys and rafts on Lake Tahoe. Serving as research stations, these vessels provide information that ensures Earth-observing satellites are measuring the Earth’s surface temperature correctly. Several environmental satellites, including Terra, Landsat, Aqua, and Envisat, fly over Lake Tahoe to collect data, with about six satellites passing by each day.  The NASA and UC Davis scientists have been collaborating to collect data on Lake Tahoe and to validate the data gathered by the environmental satellites since 1999. Initially, four rafts were deployed, until Tahoe’s harsh conditions required use of buoys that are more robust. UC Davis researchers used various parts of the broken rafts to make two new rafts, which were deployed in the southern part of the lake. There are now six research stations on Lake Tahoe.  Temperature data from the research stations can be field-tested for accuracy and compared to the satellites’ measurements for calibration. These validated NASA satellites collect temperature data, which are used for a variety of purposes, such as creating surface temperature maps used in weather forecasting, as often seen on The Weather Channel.  NASA scientists selected Lake Tahoe as a validation site just before the Terra satellite was launched on a 15-year mission to study Earth's environment in 1999. &quot;Water is the best natural target for validating thermal infrared measurements,&quot; says Simon Hook, Ph.D., who runs the Lake Tahoe validation site. Lake Tahoe provides an especially good location for calibration because the water surface is large; the lake never freezes; freshwater is easier on the equipment; and the high elevation and usually clear days reduce the amount of atmospheric interference.  Hook works on JPL's Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), one of five instruments on the satellite, Terra. ASTER views Earth with 14 spectral bands, from the visible to the thermal infrared. The instrument's visible bands produce high-resolution images of Earth's surface and clouds. The thermal infrared bands provide temperature measurements, making it possible for ASTER to spot the signs that a dormant volcano may be awakening, or see that warm water is collecting on one side of Lake Tahoe while cold water is rising on the opposite shore.  These research stations are the only permanently moored objects on the lake and each is a mini-research laboratory. Each has a radiometer that can measure the lake's surface skin temperature to within 0.05 of a degree; a temperature sensor trailing in the water that measures the lake's temperature at depth; and meteorological equipment that determines air temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, relative humidity, and net radiation.  The research stations seem to be continually growing, as more equipment is added. For example, California's Air Resources Board recently added an air sampler to the stations, and the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center has put on a deposition sampler to see  what is coming into the lake from the air. The deposition sampler enables scientists to measure the amount of nitrogen and dust falling into the lake from the atmosphere.  The data collected from these stations have multiple uses. UC Davis researchers areinvestigating lake circulation, clarity loss, and other environmental changes. Geoff Schladow, who has been studying Lake Tahoe for the last eight years, notes that, &quot;Too many nutrients in the water were once thought to be a problem, but in the past few years we started finding that fine sediment has a larger effect on clarity.&quot; The satellite data enable Schladow and his colleagues to see temperature changes across the entire lake, making it possible to understand lake circulation and its effect on the transport of fine particles.  Data from the buoy stations and satellites will enable graduate students and researchers to study the physical processes that contribute to Lake Tahoe’s unique clarity and build computer models to categorize and understand these processes. Using the data, students can build their own models in the classroom, and see firsthand the dynamic conditions that exist in these subalpine environments.  The public can also view the data online at http://terc.ucdavis.edu or http://laketahoe.jpl.nasa.gov. These Web sites provide access to some of the near-real time (NRT) data acquired from the monitoring stations. The Coast Guard and other boaters can check lake conditions, such as wind speed, air temperature and water temperature, to determine which gear to wear, for example. This online information is updated at least hourly.  The mutual benefits of this research program for the space scientists, our local scientists, students, and the public make the research buoys a good example of the kind of collaborative projects that federal, state, and local officials promote for solving Tahoe’s environmental problems.</description>

    <description>Tahoe transportation planners have been working for years to ease traffic congestion during peak tourist periods and to reduce dependence on using private vehicles to meet our transportation needs. According to scientists studying the loss of clarity in Lake Tahoe, if we can reduce air pollution from cars and trucks, we will also reduce the amount of pollution that falls into the lake from the atmosphere.  Another type of pollution caused by vehicles is dust stirred up by road traffic in the basin. Cars and trucks grind the sediment on the roadways into very fine particles, which can easily become airborne. The highway around the lake has been likened to a “mortar and pestle” by Alan Heyvaert, UC Davis researcher. These fine particles are one of the primary causes of the lake’s loss of clarity. The more cars that travel our roads, the greater the production of fine sediment particles, which can remain suspended in lake water for decades, clouding the water.  At the Aug. 21 Federal Lake Tahoe Forum, Jennifer Merchant, formerly with the Truckee North Tahoe Transportation Management Association, joined representatives of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) to announce plans to bring a new ferryboat service to operate between the north and south shores. As part of a $300-billion transportation bill, last month Congress earmarked $12 million for improving transportation services in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Of that amount, $8 million has been earmarked for a ferry service on the lake. Money will be spent on planning and designing the ferry service, intermodal transit systems to connect ferry riders to land transit systems, ferry docking, and parking for transit users.  lake’s loss of clarity.

Money will be spent on planning and designing the ferry service, intermodal transit systems to connect ferry riders to land transit systems, ferry docking, and parking for transit users. Goals for the ferry service include a reasonable fare, service time comparable to an auto trip, and a boat with clean fuel-burning technology. The ferry must also provide space for bikes and kayaks for recreation users.  Designs for the ferry include a solar-powered hybrid boat design, such as those used in Australia (www.solarsailor.com). Solar Sailor boasts that they are world leaders in the commercialization of clean, efficient, hybrid marine power. The company tagline is “green ferries for blue highways.” A catamaran of this type incorporates both solar and wind power in its propulsion system. A hybrid marine power system greatly reduces pollution emissions and increases fuel efficiency.  The Solar Sailor ferry uses solar panels and generators to charge batteries that run an electric motor driving the propellers. Generators run only when needed, and always operate at a single optimum speed. The high-torque electric motor provides direct drive to the propellers without a gearbox. This system is highly reliable, and it promises zero water pollution and zero emissions at the marina.  A hybrid electric biodiesel ferry would use 50 percent less biodiesel than a conventional ferry running on biodiesel. The Tahoe Solar Sailor would be configured for the particular water  conditions and the length of each run. This particular manufacturer has developed a 149-passenger ferry capable of sustained speeds of 20 knots (over 20 miles per hour). In windy conditions, the solar panels can be raised or lowered to act as sails to boost fuel efficiency.  The Sydney Solar Sailor was built in 2000, and it has been operating profitably in Sydney Harbor in Australia since that time. Tahoe looks forward to initiating a similar waterborne service to reduce traffic, pollution, and dust clouds; and to provide Tahoe visitors and residents with a unique alternative to driving around the lake.  Although local agencies would still need funding to operate the ferry service, and this type of system would require better transit connections than we currently have, starting a ferry service could serve as an excellent impetus for obtaining additional transit funding for Tahoe.

    <description>Segment 134 - The popular trails in Martis Valley, near Truckee, are in danger of being “loved to death.” To help protect them, a coalition of groups have obtained funding to rebuild some sections of the trail away from the creek banks, to construct a boardwalk through a delicate wetland, and to establish native plants along eroding banks.  The Martis Creek Trail was never properly constructed. It began as a cattle trail and was converted through use to a hiking trail. It runs through a wetland and along the banks of Martis Creek. Because of overuse, sections of the trail have literally fallen into the creek, increasing sediment and decreasing water quality.  Excess sediment can cause significant harm to aquatic life. Gills of fish and aquatic invertebrates become clogged, making it difficult for them to survive in the stream. Sediment can also cover important streambed habitat. Suspended sediment in the water column helps raise the water temperature and leads to lower levels of dissolved oxygen. Species that need high concentrations of dissolved oxygen, such as mayfly nymphs, stonefly nymphs, caddisfly larvae, and trout will move out or die if the dissolved oxygen levels drop too low.  Prior to heavy use by people and dogs, Martis Creek provided excellent habitat for breeding birds. In general, riparian and wetland areas are critical habitat for Sierra birds. Protecting the riparian and wetland vegetation along Martis Creek will aid bird populations.  In 2003, the Truckee River Watershed Council and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) developed a plan to preserve public access to the Martis Creek area, while protecting the natural resources there. The restoration work includes rerouting portions of the trail away from stream banks, restructuring and rebuilding portions of the trail, and stabilizing stream banks through revegetation. The Northstar Community Service District recently agreed to join the partnership and assist with upcoming work at Martis Wildlife Area.  Restoration and rerouting of the main Martis Creek Trail (Phase I) began in 2004 and will be completed in fall 2005. The construction of the boardwalk on the Tompkins Memorial Trail (Phase II) will take place during fall 2005, pending funding. Phase III is slated to begin in 2007. Organizers anticipate that the majority of the work on Phases I and II will occur on Oct. 16, Truckee River Day 2005, with some of the boardwalk construction taking place ahead of time.  Construction of the boardwalk is critical for overall project success. Part of the restoration strategy for of Martis Creek is to direct visitors away from the wetter Martis Creek Trail during the spring, when trails are muddy and revegetation work is most susceptible to damage. The current best alternative is using the Tompkins Memorial Trail, but this is also causing wetland damage. However, the good news is that the problems on the Tompkins Memorial Trail can be easily fixed by constructing approximately 400 feet of boardwalk to keep hikers and bicyclists out of the wet area on the trail.  Changing behavior of visitors to the Martis Wildlife Area is also critical for success of the project. Therefore, public outreach and education is a significant part of the restoration plan. Signs will be developed to encourage visitors to use the new trail segments and to direct users to trails other than the Martis Creek Trail during the muddy season.  At this time of year, hikers can enjoy the Martis Creek Trail with relatively low impact. From Tahoe, drive north on California State Route 267. When you have gone almost 9 miles, you will see a sign for the Martis Wildlife Viewing Area trail head on the left.  You can help protect Martis Creek in several ways. Use the newly constructed trails and avoid the restored areas of the old trails. Consider walking on other trails during the muddy season when the Martis Creek Trail is most susceptible to damage. Clean up after your dogs, since excess nutrients from pet waste can impair water quality. Bags and trash receptacles are provided by the U.S. Army Corps.  The organizations working on this restoration project need volunteer help to complete Phases I and II this fall. Call Jacqui Zink, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, (530) 587-8113, to sign up for work on National Public Lands Day, Sept. 25. You can also preregister to work on this or other restoration projects on Oct. 16, the Tenth Anniversary Truckee River Day. Call (530) 550-8760 or visit www.truckeeriverday.org for more information.</description>

    <description>Segement 135 - One of the best-attended annual volunteer events for local river restoration is Truckee River Day, organized by the Truckee River Watershed Council. This year, it is on Oct. 16 in Truckee.  Truckee River Day began 10 years ago as a partnership between local citizens and the USDA Forest Service. Since that time, dozens of restoration projects have been implemented by volunteers throughout the Truckee River watershed. This year, volunteers of all ages can help with a variety of projects to help restore the local watershed. Volunteers can help plant native vegetation on eroding sites, clear conifer slash to rehabilitate a meadow, restore spawning habitat for fish, and clean up trash.  One of the larger projects will include work on trails in the Martis Valley wildlife viewing area. This beautiful public hiking area just south of California State Route 267 in Martis Valley has nearly been loved to death by local hikers. The trail needs to be rerouted away from the edge of the stream banks, and the existing trail will be revegetated. In one area, on the Tompkins Memorial Trail, a boardwalk will be constructed over a sensitive and fragile wetland. The habitat in these areas can be damaged during the muddy season in the spring, when hiking can uproot plants in the soft, wet soil. Work on this boardwalk will start on National Public Lands Day, Sept. 25. Contact Jacqui Zink, Martis Lake Ranger, (530) 587-8113, to volunteer or for more information about this.  To celebrate this tenth anniversary of Truckee River Day, there will also be a River Fair at the end of the day on Oct. 16, at Granite Flat Campground, just south of Truckee on California State Route 89. There will be all sorts of fun, including live entertainment, food and drink, an art show, and river-related booths. One highlight will be the release of the Lahontan cutthroat trout at 4 p.m. The River Fair is open to the public, as well as to Truckee River Day volunteers.  Volunteers for Truckee River Day are required to preregister by visiting the Truckee River Watershed Council Web site at www.truckeeriverwc.org, or calling their office at (530) 550-8760. Someone from the Truckee River Watershed Council will contact you the week before Truckee River Day to tell you where to meet your group and what to bring.</description>

    <description>Segment 136 - Whether you live in the Tahoe Basin or are just visiting, you have probably seen the popular “Keep Tahoe Blue” bumper stickers. “Keep Tahoe Blue” is actually the slogan for a local environmental advocacy group, the League to Save Lake Tahoe.  The League, as it is locally known, is a private nonprofit organization with more than 5,000 members who advocate for the protection and restoration of Lake Tahoe. Since 1957, the League has worked to protect the public interest and conserve this extraordinary natural resource.  In its natural state, Lake Tahoe was blue and beautiful, clear and deep, &quot;the fairest picture the whole earth affords,&quot; according to Mark Twain. The League is concerned about how human actions are affecting its future. Excessive development, traffic congestion, polluted runoff, and unhealthy forests all threaten Tahoe's water quality and scenic beauty. The mission of the League is to protect and restore the environmental quality, scenic beauty, and low-impact recreational opportunities of the Lake Tahoe Basin.  The League has an impressive record of accomplishment. In its early years, the League fought efforts to build two bands of freeways around the lake and a bridge over the mouth of Emerald Bay. They were also instrumental in the creation of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) and the development of a regional plan for the area.  Since then, the League has become a watchdog of the Tahoe Basin environment. The League believes that it is the responsibility of the current generation to preserve the beauty and environmental health of Lake Tahoe for future generations. The League is involved in Pathway 2007 planning efforts in the basin and insists that long-term economic health is dependent on effective environmental protection.  The League is fighting efforts to expand Tahoe's urban boundaries in order to prevent urban sprawl from consuming more of the area’s forests and wetlands. The League insists that residential and business development must be carefully regulated to prevent excessive damage to the ecosystem and to avoid exacerbating Tahoe's traffic problems.  The League is also currently pressing the TRPA to limit new development in Lake Tahoe’s sensitive shorezone until environmental improvement programs are tested and proven to effectively mitigate the additional pollution that would be permitted.  In addition, the League has helped build public support for conservation of the Tahoe Basin, bring science into public decision-making, and build consensus among business and government leaders in support of protecting and restoring Lake Tahoe The League also promotes careful planning of restoration projects. They work to educate decision-makers at all levels of government and within the private sector to build consensus on restoration plans and to secure funding for important projects, such as land conservation, wetlands restoration, forest ecosystem restoration, and the development of transportation solutions. The League also works to protect Tahoe’s watershed through its community organizing and public outreach and education program. They recognize that the people who live, work, play, and manage land in the Lake Tahoe Basin need to be actively involved for conservation to succeed. The League wants people to have the tools they need to become conservation activists and good stewards of their own land. In addition to the free environmental information center at its South Lake Tahoe office, the League encourages stewardship of land by involving the community in volunteer programs. The League's primary volunteer events include an annual beach clean-up, storm drain stenciling, and Tahoe Forest Stewardship Day, which was held this year in collaboration with the Washoe Tribe in Meeks Bay.  For more information on volunteering or becoming a member of the League to Save Lake Tahoe, call their information center, (530) 541-5388, visit www.keeptahoeblue.org, or e-mail info@keeptahoeblue.org.</description>

    <description>Segment 137 - The Sierra Green Building Association will hold its Annual High Performance Green Building Tour 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Oct. 8. This guided tour will include visits to new construction and remodel projects that are designed for resource efficiency.  Green building is catching on around the country, especially in these times of rising energy costs. Buildings consume 39 percent of the energy used in the United States, more than cars or manufacturing plants, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Although new homes are twice as efficient as they were in 1970, residential buildings still account for about 20 percent of national energy use. Americans are also getting interested in green building because they are concerned about indoor air problems linked to toxic chemicals found in some building materials, carpets and furniture. The chemicals have been blamed for asthma and other respiratory problems. Many citizens are also interested in reducing outdoor pollution caused by burning fossil fuels at power plants.  The U.S. Green Building Council, a public-private partnership, developed a green building certification program called, “Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design” (LEED) in 2000. In 2005, they expanded this program to include LEED certification for homes. Also in 2005, the National Association of Home Builders issued their first voluntary green building guidelines at an industry convention.  According to Scott Terrell, of the Truckee Donner Public Utility District, there are five general criteria for a green building. “First, builders need to consider the building site and find ways to minimize disturbance of the soils and vegetation. Low-impact development principles and best management practices are critical for reducing impacts to water quality and wildlife habitat,” he says.  The second requirement is that builders design for efficient water use indoors and out. Such practices range from low-flow shower and toilet fixtures, to collection of rain in rain cisterns for use in landscape irrigation. Some designs can use water collected on rooftops for flushing toilets, while others can use nontoxic “gray water” from sink and shower drains for outdoor nonedible plant use.  The third LEED requirement is termed, “energy and atmosphere,” and involves conservation of energy and the production of energy through wind and solar power. Low-cost passive solar designs can greatly reduce heating costs. A home can be oriented and designed to gather heat through south-facing windows and store the heat in masonry floors or indoor “water walls.” The use of solar electric panels can also meet home energy needs. These measures also lessen the necessity for burning fossil fuels, which pollute the atmosphere and contribute to climate change.  The fourth requirement for green building is “materials and resources.” It involves the conservation of building materials and resources through reduction, reuse and recycling of  construction waste at the building site. This can also include the use of construction wood from companies who practice sustainable harvesting of forests and other strategies. The last requirement for green building certification is protection of indoor environmental quality. “Many new homes have a ‘new home smell’ that may be composed of gasses given off by new carpets, furniture, glues, paints, varnishes and other building materials,” Terrell explains. “Some of these may contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can be carcinogenic. Green building materials must be certified as ‘low- or no-VOC’ products.”  The new Tahoe Environmental Sciences Center, being built on the campus of Sierra Nevada College in Incline Village, is attempting to meet the green building LEED standards for certification at the platinum level. If this goal is achieved, Incline Village will be home to one of only ten platinum-rated buildings. The new science lab and classroom building is using passive solar architecture and active solar energy roof tiles (photovoltaic cells). It will also include a cogeneration plant for gas heat recovery and an atrium skylight to distribute natural lighting throughout the building. All rocks and trees from the building site are being recycled for building landscaping and trim.  You can register for this year’s Truckee and Lake Tahoe Green Building Tour by calling Rich Solinsky at (530) 587-1920. On-site registration begins at the Truckee Donner Public Utility District, 11570 Donner Pass Road, in Truckee, at 8 a.m., Oct. 8.

    <description>Segment 138 - Sustainable Tahoe and the Tahoe Adventure Club present the Biodiesel Film Festival, 7 – 9:30 p.m., Oct. 14, at the Lake Tahoe Community College Theater off Al Tahoe Boulevard in South Lake Tahoe. Admission is $3 at the door. But, what is biodiesel and why learn more about it?  Biodiesel is derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. It is an alternative fuel produced from domestic, renewable resources. Much biodiesel is manufactured from soybeans, but used restaurant oil can also be collected for biodiesel production.  Biodiesel contains no petroleum, but it can be blended with any level of petroleum diesel to create a biodiesel blend. Biodiesel blends are based on the percentage of the fuel that is pure biodiesel. A fuel known as B100 is 100 percent biodiesel, while B20 is 20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent petroleum diesel. Commonly, fuels sold for use in cars and trucks are B20, B5, or B2 blends.  One of the major advantages of biodiesel is that it can be used in existing diesel engines and fuel-injection equipment in both cars and trucks with little impact to operating performance. In more than 50 million miles of in-field demonstrations, B20 showed fuel consumption, horsepower, torque and haulage rates similar to conventional diesel fuel.  Biodiesel is registered as a fuel and fuel additive with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and meets clean diesel standards established by the California Air Resources Board.  Currently, more than 300 major fleets use biodiesel. Biodiesel use in the on-road trucking market has been growing, in part due to the promotion of biodiesel by Willie Nelson, who formed his own biodiesel company and markets B20 “BioWillie.” The U.S. Navy has issued guidance saying that biodiesel blends should be used in all nontactical vehicles. Some facilities where biodiesel is already in use include the Navy Public Works Centers in San Diego, Washington, D.C. and Pearl Harbor.  Biodiesel is the first and only alternative fuel to have completed rigorous “health effects” testing requirements for the Clean Air Act. The use of biodiesel in a conventional diesel engine results in a substantial reduction of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter compared to emissions from diesel fuel.  The EPA has released a report titled, “A Comprehensive Analysis of Biodiesel Impacts on Exhaust Emissions,” available at: www.epa.gov/otag/models/biodsl.htm. It shows that B20 results in a 20 percent reduction in total unburned hydrocarbons, a 12 percent reduction in both Carbon monoxide and particulate matter, and a 2 percent increase in nitrogen oxides. Furthermore, B20 use results in a 20 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide and sulfates, a 13 percent reduction in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and a 50 percent reduction in nitrated  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, both of which have been identified as potential cancer-causing compounds.  In addition to reducing impacts to air quality, the use of biodiesel has the potential to supplement U.S. fuel production and reduce our reliance on foreign sources of oil.  Some consumers are concerned that use of biodiesel can cause fuel filters to plug. Pure biodiesel (B100) has a solvent effect, which may release deposits accumulated on tank walls and pipes from previous diesel fuel use. With high blends of biodiesel, the release of deposits may clog filters initially, and precautions should be taken to check and replace fuel filters until the petroleum build-up is eliminated. The issue is less prevalent with B20 blends, and there is no evidence that lower-blend levels, such as B2, have caused filters to plug.  Biodiesel will gel in very cold temperatures, just as the common #2 diesel does. Blends of 20 percent biodiesel are managed with the same fuel management techniques as #2 diesel. Blends of 5 percent biodiesel and less have virtually no impact on cold flow.  To learn more about biodiesel, visit the National Biodiesel Board Web site at www.biodiesel.org. A map of retail suppliers is available in the “Buying Biodiesel” section of this Web site. Western Energetix, (800) 322-4561, currently has outlets in Sparks and Truckee that sell the B5 blend.

    <description>Segment 139 - The development of new subdivisions in the Tahoe-Truckee region can be controversial. One of the concerns about development is that it could degrade the water quality in our lakes and streams. At one proposed development near Truckee, the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board is requiring a strict program of water testing to make sure water quality is not impaired.  The proposed development of the Siller Ranch property in Martis Valley, near Truckee, would include a low-density residential development and a golf course. The control board will require water quality certification under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. Robert Coats, Ph.D., of Hydroikos Ltd. in San Rafael, California has developed a comprehensive water quality monitoring plan to ensure that the proposed development does not impair the water quality of Martis Creek or its associated aquifers.  The plan calls for frequent sampling of the water in Martis Creek throughout the year, just above and below the proposed development. Automated equipment will record continuous measurements of stream flow and turbidity. Samples of nutrients and sediment will be collected weekly during much of the year, but when summer thunderstorms and other storms occur, sampling will take place when they are of sufficient size to produce runoff.  By combining the continuous measurements of stream flow and turbidity and the weekly measurements of suspended sediment and total phosphorus, scientists will be able to estimate the total amounts of these constituents in the stream at all times.  In order to comply with the control board’s rules, contamination levels in the water must not exceed established numerical standards or threaten to impair the defined beneficial uses for the stream water, such as the propagation of cold-water fish.  A second kind of monitoring, called adaptive monitoring, will test the effectiveness of best management practices (BMPs) throughout the development. This part of the plan was developed by Lori Carpenter of Huffman and Associates. If concentrations of any pollutant are found to be elevated above background levels or are in violation of the control board’s standards, then adaptive management will trigger remedial steps.  Any water quality impairment will require inspection of all BMPs in the development and repair or improvement of any that have failed. The plan also calls for changes in the management of the golf course if it is found that golf course fertilizers or chemicals have contributed to the contamination of the stream.  Surface water will be tested during storms and during high snowmelt runoff. Five different drainage swales on or near the golf course and the overflow of golf course ponds and lakes will be sampled for nutrients and other contaminants.  Groundwater will be sampled in “dry sumps” downslope from golf course greens. It will also be sampled in three shallow groundwater monitoring wells placed between the golf course and the stream. These wells will be checked during peak snowmelt and during the growing season, after fertilizer application and irrigation.  The numerous water quality samples taken at different times of year will be compared to discover adverse water quality impacts. In addition, they will be compared with samples that have been taken above and below the parcel for over a year prior to construction of the development.  The monitoring plan created by Coats is extensive and rigorous. The monitoring stations will be installed by a team of water quality scientists, including Raph Townsend and Alan Heyvaert of the Tahoe Environmental Research Center, and Todd Mihevc of the Desert Research Institute, with help from Scott Bower of the development company, DMB/Highlands Group.  Mark Palmer of the Tahoe Environmental Research Center and High Sierra Water Laboratory will analyze the grab sample data from the golf course/BMP system and make recommendations as necessary.  In many parts of the Tahoe-Truckee region, monitoring programs such as this are needed, but they are not often funded. The data from this program will give scientists much needed information about the effectiveness of the BMPs. Coats is one of many scientists that have called for just this kind of monitoring of projects in the Tahoe Basin. “What I’m hoping is that ultimately the techniques that are being developed here will be used in the Tahoe Basin and other sites in the Sierra, so that our work will contribute to the technology that’s available for measuring water quality impacts,” he says.</description>

    <description>Segment 140 - A tiny snail from New Zealand is infesting streams throughout the western United States and wreaking havoc on the aquatic food web.  The New Zealand mudsnail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) is so small that it is difficult to see. An adult snail is about the size of a pencil lead. However, when these snails infest a stream, they can greatly reduce the food supply for trout.  The New Zealand mudsnail lives in a variety of habitats, ranging from estuaries to large rivers and small streams. It can reproduce sexually or through the process of parthenogenesis, which produces clones of the adult mudsnail. In its native waters, the mudsnail population is primarily kept in check by trematode (small worm) parasites that sterilize the snail or change mudsnail behavior, making it more likely that they will be eaten by foraging waterfowl. However, there are no natural predators of the mudsnail in the United States.  The mudsnails can rapidly populate an environment. More than 700,000 mudsnails per square meter have been found in some waters. They feed on bottom-dwelling algae (periphyton) and detritus (dead leaves, etc.). Because they are so numerous, they dominate the base of the food web, with an ability to consume over 80 percent of a river’s productivity. This leaves little algae and decaying organic matter to feed native aquatic organisms. The mudsnails decrease the supply of mayflies, stoneflies, caddis flies and some midges. These are very important food for trout.  The mudsnails have been documented in the watersheds of the Columbia, Snake, Missouri, and Colorado Rivers. In 2000, they made landfall in California in the Lower Owens River near Bishop. Since then, they have moved throughout the Owens drainage, including Hot Creek. In October 2003, mudsnails were also discovered in Putah Creek near Davis. Two months later, they were found in the Mokelumne River in the Sierra. In January 2004, a well-established population was discovered in an 11-mile reach of the Calaveras River.  Evidence strongly points toward wading anglers as the primary source for the spread of mudsnails. In a recent survey of 50 wading anglers at Putah Creek, all of the fishermen had mudsnails on their waders and/or in their boots (an average of 33 snails per angler!). The majority of the snails were less than 1mm and nearly invisible, yet fully capable of cloning themselves in a remote site and infecting an entire watershed.  Since mudsnail populations can't be controlled once they become established, the first order of defense is containment. Angler awareness is paramount. Thorough decontamination of wading gear is mandatory to halt the spread of these mudsnails.  To decontaminate, anglers should mix equal parts of Formula 409 degreaser/disinfectant and water, and then soak their gear in the solution for five minutes. Then, they need to dunk their gear in a bucket or put it into a river runner’s “dry” bag, shake it, and let it steep for five  minutes. Testing to develop this decontamination of fishing gear was performed by the California Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in conjunction with the Federation of Fly Fishers, California Trout and private anglers. Cal Fed provided funding. Orvis, Patagonia, and Simms generously donated wading equipment. Ralph Cutter, of Truckee’s California School of Fly-fishing, is helping these agencies spread the word about how to prevent the spread of the New Zealand mudsnail. According to Cutter, “The Truckee, Carson and Walker River watersheds are excellent mudsnail habitat. The potential environmental and economic harm to the region is enormous. Our angling and tourist-based communities need to wake up and work proactively to keep the snail at bay. Once it arrives, there will be nothing we can do but watch and wait to see how bad the impact will be.”</description>

    <description>Segement 141 - When Coe Swobe first got involved in planning for the future of Lake Tahoe in the 1960s, many developers and officials had big ideas about development of the Tahoe Basin. “It appeared at that time that some people in county governments were competing to see how many subdivisions they could get approved,” he says.  In the 1950s, the owners of the wetlands at the foot of the Upper Truckee River had been able to convince county officials that dredging and filling the wetlands for the Tahoe Keys was a good use for the “useless swampland.”  There was even a proposal for a freeway circling Lake Tahoe, with a bridge across the mouth of Emerald Bay. Another freeway was proposed to follow an alignment not far from the current Tahoe Rim Trail. Imagine a Tahoe Rim Freeway! Swobe says it appeared to him that local governments at that time sought growth and development, because it would improve the tax base. Projections for the population of the basin at build-out ranged from 300,000 to over 600,000 people.  “There were about 60 different agencies with jurisdiction over development proposals at Lake Tahoe. We needed to have an agency that could formulate one set of minimum uniform standards for development that would protect the environment,” Swobe explains.  Nevada Gov. Paul Laxalt; California Gov. Ronald Reagan; Swobe, then a state senator; and others who appreciated the unique and fragile beauty of the Tahoe Basin called for the governments of California and Nevada to form a Joint Study Committee in 1965. Laxalt and Reagan feared that Lake Tahoe might turn gray on their watch, and this was something they did not want for their legacy.  The Joint Study Committee recommended that a Tahoe Regional Planning Agency be formed by California and Nevada. Swobe helped write the legislation that was passed by each state legislature in 1968. In 1969, the U.S. Congress approved the Lake Tahoe Bi-state Compact, which was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in December.  The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) held its first meeting in March 1970. There were difficulties and growing pains at first, and the USDA Forest Service and many local citizens worked hard to solve early problems. The Compact was amended in 1980.  Once the TRPA created its planning and development standards, all the counties had to impose the same restrictions for land use on wetlands, steep slopes and other erosion-prone areas. Subdivision of land slowed down dramatically. Many current residents and visitors are glad that the TRPA was formed to limit development and protect the water quality and natural beauty of the basin.  The long-term plans of the TRPA, the USDA Forest Service, the Lahontan Water Quality Control Board and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection are now due for revision. In a process known as Pathway 2007, citizens and agency staff from both states are currently updating the plans in a coordinated fashion. Since the revisions of all plans are due in 2007, the four agencies have convened many technical working groups and a citizens’ advisory group, called the Forum, to formulate improvements to the plans.  Much discussion has taken place in the past year to determine the “desired conditions” for the lake and its watershed. In our next four articles, we will examine the components of a new, comprehensive vision for the future of the Tahoe Basin. We will look at the vision of citizens for the future of transportation, recreation, and socioeconomic conditions in the basin. We will also examine some of the values that people hold for the vegetation, scenery, fish and wildlife habitat, and water and air quality in the basin.  The formation of a vision for Tahoe’s future is open to all citizens. To get involved in the process, see the Web site www.pathway2007.org.</description>

    <description>Segment 142 - The ambitious process to create long-term plans for Tahoe’s future has resulted in a set of proposed “desired conditions” that create a vision for the future. That vision includes what the public wants to see, what resource specialists see as achievable and measurable, and the requirements of federal and state laws for the environment. This is the first of four articles that will delve into the components of the vision for the Tahoe Basin. Today’s article will examine the desired conditions for vegetation and scenic environmental thresholds.  The way the scenery and vegetation should look in the Tahoe Basin is a topic of major importance for planners putting together the Pathway 2007 Management Plans. Pathway 2007 will guide the way natural resources and urban planning will be managed in the Tahoe Basin over the next 20 or more years, as well as influence regulations policies. The Pathway 2007 Evaluation Report is an important document that has been released and is now available at www.pathway2007.org. It addresses the current conditions of Tahoe’s vegetation and scenic resources, among other issues, and sets forth a list of “desired conditions” as targets for the next 20 years.  The forest around Lake Tahoe has been drastically altered over the past 150 years. In the late 1800s, the basin was used for clear-cut logging during the Comstock mining boom in Virginia City. When the forest grew back in the 20th century, wildfires were quickly extinguished, denying the forest its natural fuel reduction process. As a result, today we have a forest thick with mature trees that are typically about the same age and size.  “What we have today is a forest that has much more understory vegetation and denser concentrations of mature trees,” explains Dave Fournier of the USDA Forest Service. “The combination of fire suppression and Comstock logging has resulted in an unhealthy forest,” he says. He also stresses that unhealthy forest conditions are not universal in the basin, but are most common closest to where people live, in the “wildland-urban interface” area.  The vegetation chapter of the Pathway 2007 Evaluation Report defines the vision of the forests of Tahoe’s future. That forest is described as “a mosaic of diverse plant communities,” capable of supporting biodiversity, endangered species, rich habitat, water quality, air quality, recreation opportunities, and scenic resources.  The trees need to be more widely spaced, allowing native shrubs and plants to grow underneath them. This will also help to achieve the desired future conditions for scenic values around Lake Tahoe. When tree density is reduced, the forest becomes less susceptible to drought stress and the attendant problems of disease and bark beetle infestations.  Restored and healthy forests are also far less vulnerable to catastrophic wildfire. In fact, one of the desired conditions for vegetation is to reduce the intensity of fire, especially near urban areas. Because there is so much fuel in our forest, both live and dead, wildfires here will  burn hotter than they would in a healthier forest, killing large trees that could survive less intense fires in healthier conditions.  According to Rex Norman of the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, “We may never be able to restore the forests and vegetation of the basin as they were before settlement, but we can recover much of the health and appearance of the original Tahoe forests.”  The chapter on scenic resources echoes the refrain of other chapters, that the strength of our economy is linked with protection of the “scenic identity” of the Tahoe Basin. It defines two desired conditions for 2027. The first is that “the views from the region’s major roadways, Lake Tahoe, public recreation areas, trails, and communities are of the dominant natural-appearing forest, meadows, mountain backdrop, and shoreline of Lake Tahoe.”  The second desired condition for scenic resources is that “the built environment of the Lake Tahoe Basin serves as a model for successfully integrating natural landscape attributes and cultural, community-valued aesthetic attributes,” and that “the Tahoe built environment reflects and harmonizes with the attributes of Tahoe’s natural scenery.”  For each desired condition defined in the Evaluation Report, there are also proposed indicators and standards to allow tracking of progress toward agreed upon goals over the next 20 years.  To get involved with establishing the 20-year goals for Lake Tahoe, visit www.pathway2007.org. There is a direct link to the Evaluation Report there, as well as ways to participate in the public process. The next Pathway 2007 meeting, focusing on socioeconomics and noise, is on Nov. 10 at the North Tahoe Conference Center in Kings Beach.</description>

    <description>Segment 143 - Today’s article, the second in a series of four, examines the “desired conditions” for transportation, recreation and socioeconomics in the Tahoe Basin as part of Pathway 2007. Pathway 2007 is a partnership between four public agencies at Lake Tahoe to create a vision for Lake Tahoe’s future.  Lake Tahoe Basin planning officials of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the USDA Forest Service, the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board, and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection are engaging the public in a unique process that will guide the land management, resource management, and environmental planning and regulations for the next 20 years or more.  Desired Conditions under Discussion  A desired condition is a vision of the future – essentially, what our collective goals are aiming toward. As part of the Pathway 2007 planning process, these desired conditions should reflect what the public wants to see, what resource specialists see as achievable and measurable, and the requirements of federal and state laws for the environment.  The proposed desired conditions for the natural and human environments of the Lake Tahoe Basin represent the first stage of the Pathway 2007 planning process. The Pathway 2007 Evaluation Report, available at www.pathway2007.org, is intended to initiate a dialog between the public and the Pathway 2007 agencies. A citizen’s advisory committee – called the Pathway Forum – is a critical link for gathering and sharing public input. The evaluation report was prepared using information from public meetings, surveys, as well as input from technical working groups. Through this dialog, the draft desired conditions, indicators and standards will be refined over time.  Pathway 2007 represents an unprecedented amount of public involvement at Lake Tahoe. Collaboration is often challenging and controversial. Disagreements are part of the process. For example, the discussions about transportation have highlighted the range of opinions about how best to measure improvements in our transportation system at the lake. The need for better transportation data is clear and local agencies are addressing this need. The public has repeatedly stressed the need to resolve traffic, parking and transit challenges at Lake Tahoe. How can we offer more options for people to get to Tahoe and then once here, move around better? How can we make Lake Tahoe more pedestrian friendly? These are questions being tackled by the Pathway Forum and Pathway agencies. It is important to note that no final decisions have been made by the Pathway Forum or Pathway public agencies. Committees and working groups will be busy over the next three months before official recommendations will come from the Forum to agency decision makers.  Recreation is a Hot Topic  The desired conditions in the chapter on recreation describe a future in which Lake Tahoe remains an outstanding recreation destination. It addresses the desire for increased shoreline access, and foresees opportunities to increase awareness and education to help manage recreation impacts. Both the agency planners and the Forum members recognize the inevitable increases in recreation, the need to manage recreation and its impacts, and the relationship of recreation to the economy and the Tahoe lifestyle. The Pathway Forum members had a robust discussion over the subject of recreation and the need for more work by the technical working groups and Pathway partners.  The Economy and our Quality of Life  The chapter on Socioeconomics defines the desired condition of a healthy economy with sustainable employment and earnings opportunities, workforce housing for a greater number of employees, pedestrian-friendly town centers, and stable, socially cohesive communities. The “triple bottom line” model is being discussed in this context—the idea is that public policy decisions should be made in ways that create wealth for the environment, the economy, and the community. These are the measures of our quality of life. With this recognition of the interdependency of a healthy environment and the regional economy, the socioeconomics proposals call for a balanced regulatory framework with consistency from agency to agency for the public, including project applicants and others. The Forum discussed the need for reasonable regulations that do not have negative unintended consequences for small and local businesses.  The socioeconomics section of the report does not propose social or economic standards, but does propose “indicators” or well established ways of measuring important social and economic trends. Information on trends can significantly inform and educate agency decision makers as to the effects of decisions. Pathway 2007 is an effort to ensure coordination between different public agencies and to share resources and expertise while inviting public participation. Working together, the goal for 2007 is to have each agency plan complete and ready for approval, and to be consistent with one another. To make your voice heard, please get involved. You can learn how by visiting the website at www.pathway2007.org. The Draft Evaluation Report is only a starting place for public dialog and refinement.  The next Pathway 2007 meeting will focus on water quality and soils coverage. The meeting is scheduled for November 17 at the Lake Tahoe Community College in South Lake Tahoe.</description>

    <description>Segment 144 - On Dec. 1, at the Chateau in Incline Village, the Pathway 2007 Forum will consider proposed desired conditions for wildlife, fisheries and stream environment zones (SEZs – commonly referred to as wetlands). The Pathway Forum is a citizens’ committee formed to ensure the public has a voice in planning for Lake Tahoe’s future.  While healthy, undisturbed stream zones are an important factor in protecting Tahoe’s water quality, they are also critical for maintaining fish and wildlife health in the basin. A document called the draft Evaluation Report, available online at www.pathway2007.org, states, “Stream environment zones are complete ecosystems, so it is necessary to monitor the health of each of their component parts to assess their overall health.”  The proposed vision for SEZs (including waters, wetlands, riparian or streamside areas, meadows and beaches) is to maintain and enhance the natural functions and ecological integrity of SEZs, along with the societal functions and values SEZs provide. Naturally functioning SEZs help purify water and provide important flood control and wildlife habitat functions. Dense vegetation within SEZs protects stream banks from soil erosion that could release harmful suspended sediment and cloud the lake.  The Lake Tahoe Basin Regional Plan set goals for restoration of disturbed SEZs in urban areas two decades ago. Of the 4,400 acres of SEZs in urban areas that have been “disturbed, developed or subdivided,” the threshold goal was to restore 25 percent or 1,100 acres. To date, approximately 365.5 acres of SEZ lands have been restored within the urban boundary.  There is little data available for evaluating how well these restored SEZs are functioning.  One of the purposes of conducting the Pathway 2007 threshold review is to establish better indicators and standards for tracking actual progress toward this kind of restoration goal. SEZ experts are creating a basinwide inventory of all disturbed and restored SEZs as one way to improve progress. The Evaluation Report states that technical experts in wildlife, fisheries and vegetation should draft indicators and standards for SEZ biological functions and values.  The wildlife and fisheries desired conditions include three categories:  • the biological integrity of terrestrial ecosystems,  • the sustainability of special-status species (threatened, endangered, rare, special-interest or sensitive species), and  • the biological integrity of aquatic ecosystems.  The vision for wildlife and fisheries is to have a full range of diverse habitats and ecological processes that support a wide variety of native species.  With regard to fisheries, the proposed vision is to provide environmental conditions that support cold-water species adapted to nutrient-poor or “oligotrophic” aquatic conditions. Lake Tahoe is an oligotrophic lake, meaning it’s extremely clear and cold. However, because of past alterations in the food web, non-native fish dominate Lake Tahoe. The report states, “This condition will not limit attempts to restore native fish assemblages to the region.”  Land stewardship should emphasize restoration and maintenance of intact and connected aquatic habitats and natural processes to maintain native aquatic plant and animal communities, not just fish. Some water bodies in the basin historically did not support fish.  Terrestrial ecosystems are sometimes called “uplands” to distinguish them from areas significantly influenced by standing and flowing water. However, many upland wildlife species depend on fully functioning aquatic environments to fulfill their needs for water, cover, and food.  The lake environment is interwoven in many ways. Just as the community and the environment depend on each other, so do various components of the ecosystem. The ability to achieve wildlife and fishery goals will require that planning and conservation actions consider the interconnectedness of environmental resources in other areas. For example, water quality depends on the health of soils, vegetation, stream zones and air quality. Both aquatic and terrestrial species also depend on healthy stream zones, and all depend on healthy soils and vegetation.  Next week, in the fourth article of this Pathway 2007 series, we will look at the proposed desired conditions for the interdependent air quality, water quality and soils resource topics.</description>

    <description>Segment 145 - The Pathway 2007 planners have proposed lofty goals for the future of Tahoe’s soil, air and water quality. The goals for these key components of the regional ecosystem are to meet the highest standards for exceptional environmental quality.  The water quality goals proposed are to protect human health as well as the health of underwater animals and plants. The goal being discussed is also intended to restore, maintain and protect the waters of Lake Tahoe for purposes of human enjoyment and preserving its rare ecological status as one of the few large, deepwater, ultra-oligotrophic (extremely clear, cold) lakes in the world.  With regard to protection of human and environmental health, the proposed desired conditions are to have water that is free from toxic chemicals and controllable pathogens, and that supports desired aquatic habitat, aquatic life, and food web characteristics that would be expected in this clear, cold mountain lake.  For Lake Tahoe’s water to improve from a transparency depth of 73.6 feet in 2004 to a Secchi depth of 97.4 feet (29.7 meters) that was measured in the late 1960s, lake pollution by fine sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus must be reduced. Runoff and dust containing these pollutants are the main culprits of clarity loss at Lake Tahoe since the 1960s. Scientists working on the proposed Tahoe Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) are developing models to estimate the needed pollutant load reductions for achieving the desired lake clarity. A water quality management strategy is being developed as part of the Pathway 2007 process, and it will require further reductions in the delivery of pollutants such as fine sediments, nitrogen and phosphorus to lake waters.  Stormwater, tributary streams, groundwater, and atmospheric deposition are all sources of fine sediments and nutrients which affect lake clarity. The environmental thresholds for soils and air quality are closely related to these key pollution sources. For example, stormwater and tributary pollution are the result of increased soil disturbance and too much land coverage in a sub-watershed. Atmospheric deposition of dust (fine sediment) into the lake is likewise a result of impaired air quality.  The proposed desired conditions for air quality are divided into three categories: visibility, human health, and lake clarity and forest health. The visibility goals are to maintain at least 72 miles of visual range from Bliss State park and at least 34 miles of visual range at South Lake Tahoe for 90 percent of the year. For half of the days in each year, these visual ranges should be 116 and 58 miles, respectively.  The proposed air quality conditions for human health are to have “zero exceedances” of the most restrictive standards for ozone, carbon monoxide and particulate matter anywhere in the basin. Excessive amounts of ozone in the air can also harm the basin’s pine trees, but the  ozone standard proposed for the human health desired condition should be sufficient to protect forest health.  While the standards for air quality have not been determined for lake clarity protection, it is clear that both nutrients and dust can enter the lake through the air. Fine particles that are less than 10 microns in diameter (very small) remain suspended in water, thus reducing water clarity. Therefore, this microscopic size class of particle must be reduced within the air quality standards in order to protect water quality.  One difficult tradeoff for Pathway 2007 planners is the need to reduce the amount of forest fuels, often by prescribed burning. Because prescribed burns directly affect air quality, planners will need to decide how to provide maximum benefit to both forest health and air quality objectives in upcoming discussions.  The proposed desired conditions for soil conservation include sustaining “soil health” and having development compatible with the soil’s capability to respond to urban pressures. The proposed desired condition for soil health is that soils will function at the level of native soils in their capacity to regulate water flow and infiltration, sustain plant and animal life, process nutrients, and filter potential pollutants.  The proposed goal for land capability is that “land development and land use are compatible with the amount of use an area can tolerate without sustaining permanent damage to soil vegetation and/or watershed functions. Land disturbance and land coverage should not cause deterioration of stream systems and/or water quality.”  Before a new land capability standard can be proposed, a thorough review of the Bailey system, Individual Parcel Evaluation System (IPES) plus the land coverage transfer and mitigation system is planned. The new Lake Tahoe Basin Soil Survey, due for release in mid-2006 also factors into this review.  Stream environment zones (SEZ), discussed last week in relation to wildlife and fisheries goals, also tie back to both soil conservation and water quality goals. One of the fascinating aspects of the exhaustive Pathway 2007 planning process is the way all the components of our environment (the thresholds) must be considered in relation to each other. As John Muir said, “If you try to pull out any aspect of nature and look at it, you find it is hitched to everything else in the universe.”  The next scheduled meeting of the Pathway 2007 Forum is the December 1 at the Chateau in Incline Village from 9 am to 4:30 pm. The Forum is a citizen’s group that is your direct link to participate in Pathway. Check www.pathway2007.org for more details.</description>

    <description>During the last big rainstorm, researcher Alan Heyvaert took the time to show us the difference between stream flow from a natural area and urban runoff from roads. The visual impact was astonishing. Water from the natural stream was clear and had very few suspended particles. On the other hand, urban runoff from a nearby road was dark brown and cloudy.  After several hours, the urban runoff samples slowly got lighter in color and slightly less cloudy, but the water never returned to clear. This also happens in Lake Tahoe. Whenever you see murky or brownish water flowing downslope during a storm, that water is going to cause clarity problems for the lake.  Heyvaert likened the roads around Lake Tahoe to a mortar and pestle. “Cars driving around the Tahoe Basin grind the soils and winter traction sands on roadways into a fine dust… like a mortar and pestle.” This pulverized material then is washed by storm water and blown by wind into surrounding areas, and ultimately into the lake. In addition, any other soil erosion that occurs around the watershed tends to mobilize particles of all sizes, which travel toward the lake. It is the smallest of these particles that are the most damaging to water clarity. They remain suspended in the lake water for a long time because they are too small to settle rapidly to the bottom.  Too small to see  The average human hair has a diameter of about 100 microns, and it takes about 2,500  microns to make an inch. For Lake Tahoe, it is the sediment particles ranging from about 1 micron to 10 microns that are of particular concern. These particles are too small to see except with a powerful microscope, but due to their relative abundance in the water column and their optical properties, they are the largest contributing factor to Tahoe’s clarity loss.  Theoretical calculations show that a 10-micron soil particle of typical shape and density will take over 100 days to settle to the average depth of the lake floor (313 meters or 1,027 feet) under ideal conditions (without wind-driven currents or lake upwellings). A 4-micron particle will take almost 1,000 days to settle to this depth under ideal conditions. However, storm winds usually mix the lake water to a depth of 300 meters or more each winter, so many of these particles are brought back up to the surface before they can reach the bottom.  Particles sizes of 1 micron to 10 microns are extremely effective at scattering light, which is a major cause of clarity loss. Researchers now contend that approximately 50 percent of the light scattering that represents clarity loss in Lake Tahoe is caused by small, inorganic sediment particles. About 30 percent of the clarity loss is due to algae, and another 20 percent is due to dissolved organic matter in the water. Although these proportions vary seasonally, it is clear that small, inorganic sediment particles are contributing 50 percent or more of the total clarity loss in the lake.  If resource and property managers at Lake Tahoe want to improve the lake’s clarity, they must retain fine sediments up in the watershed, in the soil-plant community. Erosion must be controlled by implementing best management practices (BMPs). Property owners must infiltrate runoff as near to its source as possible, before it can erode soil. One effective method is to plant native and adapted plants, such as those listed in the “Home Landscaping Guide for Lake Tahoe,” which are effective at infiltrating water and holding soil in place. (Call University of Nevada Cooperative Extension, 832-4150, for information on obtaining a copy of the guide.)  To remove sediment that is suspended in runoff, public jurisdictions often construct storm-water treatment basins that cause the sediment in runoff to settle to the bottom of the basins. Unfortunately, storm-water detention basins are not usually effective at removing particles smaller than about 20 microns in diameter. Data is now being collected to determine if wetland retention basins, designed as biological systems that treat storm water, might be more effective at removing the fine sediments suspended in runoff.  If wetland retention basins are more effective, then more of them will be designed and constructed. This is an example of how the Tahoe Basin is employing adaptive management. Scientists are doing research on the lake, and the jurisdictions then apply new knowledge to make management practices more effective at preventing lake pollution. Ideally, a subsequent assessment of project performance leads to even better design and management strategies.</description>

    <description>Segment 147 - Scientific researchers measure the clarity of Lake Tahoe water every ten days by submerging the Secchi disk into the lake to see how deeply they can submerge it and still see it. They also collect water quality samples in streams and in the lake. Another very important tool used in their lake research is weather data.  Seasonal changes in solar radiation cause variations in water temperature, which in turn drive lake currents. These changes can cause the lake to mix from bottom to top during the winter. This mixing helps to keep sediment suspended in the water and contributes to loss in water clarity.  To collect meteorological data, UC Davis and NASA operate 12 weather stations around and in Lake Tahoe. Six are located on piers, and six are on buoys in the lake.  “The meteorological information that we gather is the backbone of what we do,” says Geoff Schladow from UC Davis. “By analyzing the data, we can understand what happens in the lake. We can explain how pollutants are transported across the lake and understand why the clarity changes day to day. These models are driven by meteorological data.”  Schladow, who has been studying Lake Tahoe for the last eight years, also notes that, &quot;We once thought that plant nutrients in the lake were the greatest problem, but in the past few years we started finding that fine sediment has a larger effect on clarity.&quot;  Since the buoys communicate with remote sensing satellites, Schladow and his colleagues can map temperature changes across the entire lake, making it possible to understand lake circulation and its effect on the transport of fine particles.  UC Davis has posted data from its REMOTE Meteorological stations on the Web at http://remote.ucdavis.edu/tahoe_location.asp. The site has information on wind speed, wind direction, wind gust, air temperature, air pressure, radiation, precipitation, relative humidity, and water temperature. The data is also online at http://terc.ucdavis.edu and http://laketahoe.jpl.nasa.gov.  Graduate students and researchers can use the REMOTE Web site to study the physical processes that contribute to Lake Tahoe’s unique clarity and build computer models to categorize and understand these processes. Using the data, students can build their own models in the classroom, and see firsthand the dynamic conditions that exist in subalpine environments.  In addition to the UC Davis stations, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) maintains an automated SNOTEL system that collects and relays snowpack and related climatic data to their Web site, http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov.  The U.S. Geological Survey also posts weather, stream flow, and water quality data, as well as digital maps and orthophoto quadrangles, on their Lake Tahoe Data Clearinghouse Web site, http://tahoe.usgs.gov.  Another valuable Web site for scientific information is the Tahoe Integrated Information Management System (TIIMS) site, http://www.tiims.org/. This is an interactive Web site being developed to house and disseminate information about Lake Tahoe Basin planning and restoration efforts. TIIMS also contains a valuable public outreach component that offers educational materials, photographs, and information on how to become involved in Lake Tahoe Basin restoration efforts.  These Web sites provide access to some of the near-real-time data acquired from scientific monitoring stations. The Coast Guard and other boaters can check lake conditions, such as wind speed, air temperature and water temperature, to determine which gear to wear, for example. This online information is updated at least hourly.  You too can go online anytime to decide whether to go skiing, hiking, boating, or just stay inside by the fire. You can make use of Tahoe’s 12 advanced meteorological stations for detailed information beyond what you find on the Weather Channel.</description>

    <description>Segment 148 -The Workforce Housing Association of Truckee Tahoe (WHATT) was formed by a group of local business people concerned about the scarcity of affordable housing options for employees in our region. Forums held in 2001 by the North Lake Tahoe Resort Association and the Truckee-Donner Chamber of Commerce provided the impetus for forming the association.  The mission of the association is to work with employers, employees, and the community to advocate for the implementation of affordable workforce housing in the Truckee/North Tahoe Region.  Generally, housing is considered affordable when a household pays less than 30 percent of its monthly income for housing, including utilities. In 2004, a Truckee household of four persons earning less than $31,800 per year was considered “very low income.” Households earning between $31,800 and $50,900 per year were considered “low income,” and households earning between $50,900 and $76,300 per year were considered “moderate income.”  According to the WHATT Web site (www.whatt.org), in 2000, 3,670 Truckee-North Lake Tahoe households paid more that 30 percent of their income for housing. Experienced workers in all income segments are leaving to find better housing situations. This hurts local businesses that have a smaller workforce from which to recruit employees, and it hurts the community. Rachelle Pellissier, WHATT Executive Director, says, “In order to sustain a balanced, year-round economy, a region needs people of all age and income levels to live and work there.”  The WHATT Web site explains the extent of the problem with recent real estate statistics. It reports, “In the Tahoe Sierra Board of Realtors' region, in April 2005, there were 298 houses and condos for sale. Of these, 9.4 percent (27 properties) were priced less than $500,000. The average listing price was $1,199,000.”  According to the association’s analysis, the affordable purchase price of a home for a moderate-income family that makes 120 percent of median income ($76,000), with a 5 percent down payment is $314,000. Comparing that purchase power to the market prices of housing in the region shows the vast extent of the affordability gap.  The Workforce Housing Association is working with Nevada and Placer Counties and the Town of Truckee to create development requirements that will provide more affordable housing in the region. The “Housing Element” of the 2005 Truckee General Plan Update has established lofty goals for affordable housing. In new residential developments, a certain percentage of the units will be required to be affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate- income households.  Already, there are signs of improvement for workforce housing. In the summer of 2005, the Town of Truckee Planning Commission approved two developments containing 122 affordable housing units. At their July 27 meeting, the Planning Commission approved Spring Creek, a 66-unit neighborhood consisting of 30 units of &quot;for-sale&quot; housing affordable to moderate-income families (120 percent of median income) and 36 market rate units. At their Aug. 2 meeting, the Planning Commission approved the Gray's Crossing Apartments, a 92-unit rental complex affordable to very low-income (50 percent of median income) and low-income (60 percent of median income) families.  Pellissier applauds the Town of Truckee for their efforts to address the affordable workforce housing shortage by fast tracking these important developments. Learn more about the Town of Truckee Housing Element at www.truckee2025.org/docs/hsngelem3.pdf.  WHATT recently received a $245,000, two-year grant from the S. H. Cowell Foundation that will help the organization to expand beyond its advocate role, and help it to become a more aggressive housing agency. New roles for the organization may include development partner, community outreach coordinator, and long-term steward of the region’s scarce affordable housing resources.</description>

    <description>Segment 149 -  Students, parents and volunteers have created habitat for birds and small animals in the schoolyard between Kings Beach Elementary School and the Boys and Girls Club next door. This educational project, like the one at Tahoe Lake School in Tahoe City, has earned Kings Beach Elementary approval as a Schoolyard Habitat site from the National Wildlife Federation.  On May 17 and June 11, the Sierra Watershed Education Partnerships (SWEP) and numerous community volunteers staged work parties to prepare the soil in the planter boxes. Chris Cooper, maintenance supervisor for Tahoe Truckee Unified School District, used a backhoe to remove some of the rocks and mineral soil left over from construction. Rockwood Inc. donated use of a dump truck and crew to haul it to a safe storage site where wind and water could not erode it. Once there was room in the planter boxes, compost from Full Circle Compost in Minden was mixed with the remaining mineral soil. The organic matter in the compost amends the mineral soil, enriching it greatly, so fertilization of the plants was not necessary.  On June 15, students from Kings Beach Elementary planted $1,500 of native and adapted plants funded by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Services. The plants were purchased at a generous discount from Tahoe Tree Company, Perennial Nursery, and Villager Nursery. Native and adapted plants are well-suited to Tahoe’s climate and soil conditions, needing little irrigation or fertilizer once they are established.  Native plants are adapted plants that were already established in the Lake Tahoe area when European-American settlers arrived in the 1800s. The children are working to develop bilingual signs to place in the garden to help community members learn more about the value of  native and adapted plants.  Project MANA used one planter box to establish a vegetable garden with the North Tahoe Boys and Girls Club. Project MANA is a North Lake Tahoe nonprofit organization dedicated to providing food for needy families.  Local Master Gardener volunteers of University of Nevada Cooperative Extension helped identify appropriate plants for a shade garden, a drought-tolerant garden and a butterfly garden. The native and adapted shrubs included thimbleberry, wild rose, snowberry, currant, wild strawberry, spiraea and serviceberry. The flowers included penstemon, phlox, Jacob’s ladder, coneflower, and forget-me-not. Such plants require very little maintenance and provide wildlife habitat, including food and shelter. In addition, their roots spread and hold the soil in place, preventing erosion. Planting native and adapted plants to cover bare soil is an important best management practice (BMP) for protecting water quality in Lake Tahoe.  A complete list of recommended native and adapted plants, approved by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, is included in the “Home Landscaping Guide for Lake Tahoe and Vicinity,” published by University of Nevada Cooperative Extension. It is available through the  Nevada Tahoe Conservation District in Nevada, (775) 586-1610, ext.28; and through the Tahoe Resource Conservation District in California, (530) 543-1501, ext. 6.  The Sierra Watershed Education Partnerships and its partners, including Excellence in Education, Tahoe Resource Conservation District and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, are eager to work with teachers and administrators to create this type of BMP demonstration project at other school sites.

    <description>Segment 150 - The recently constructed Alder Creek Middle School in Truckee incorporates some of the latest “green” technology. It is a demonstration for a program called the Collaboration for High Performance Schools (CHPS). It was designed according to CHPS criteria through a grant from the California Energy Commission.  High-performance schools combine the best of today's design strategies and building technologies. They conserve energy, resources, and water, while providing a healthy and comfortable indoor environment. High-performance schools are cost-effective and help to protect the environment. They serve as a teaching tool for both students and community members.  According to the CHPS Web site, www.chps.net, high-performance schools create a better learning environment for children. Recent studies show a direct link between high-performance design features and increased test scores. For example, naturally lit rooms have been proven to boost student productivity and improve visual acuity.  Rob Koster of the Truckee Tahoe Unified School District was the project manager for the design and construction of the school. He is enthusiastic about the green technology in the school, and makes sure teachers know how the technology can enhance the educational experience.  Alder Creek Middle School employs natural lighting as a resource-efficient technology that also improves the teaching environment. The school’s skylights and windows are designed to reflect incoming light to the white ceilings, eliminating the glare and shadows caused by direct sunlight.  The orientation of the structure maximizes the delivery of this indirect lighting to the classrooms, so electric fixtures are only needed for supplemental lighting. Motion sensors automatically turn off the lights if the classrooms are not in use.  The school also saves thousands of dollars each year by using high-efficiency ground source heat pumps. A field of 288 wells, drilled 300 feet beneath the soccer field, circulate and slightly warm water. The water is then pumped into the school where it is used to heat the classrooms. In summer, the system can also be used to cool the school.  Many of the school’s building materials came from recycled products. The students also run a schoolwide recycling program, with recycle bins in all rooms in the building. Every week, students from Sue Mock’s sixth grade ecology class collect the bins, sort the items, and place them in proper receptacles for pickup by the Tahoe Truckee Sierra Disposal Company. The disposal company transports the recyclables to their Materials Recovery Facility.  Scott Terrell of the Truckee-Donner Public Utility District is working with many community members to add a Photovoltaic Demonstration System that will convert sunlight to electric power. The school received a $10,000 grant from the “A-Plus for Energy” program of British Petroleum (BP). Local residents and businesses donated an additional $9,000 for the photovoltaic system. The demonstration system will consist of solar panels mounted on a pole. The array of panels will move with a tracking device to follow the movement of the sun across the sky each day.  Once the photovoltaic system is installed, Terrell hopes the school will qualify for “Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design” (LEED) certification as a sustainable building, as this will further enhance its value as a teaching tool. In addition to the work of Scott Terrell and Rob Koster, project assistance is being provided by Solar Wind Works; Jason Wooley of Lot C Architecture; Arthur Fellows, structural engineer; and Tony Pastore and Andrew Ryan of Pastore-Ryan EcoDesign.  The UC Berkeley Sagehen Field Station and the Truckee River Watershed Council will host a symposium, “Climate Change in the Sierra Nevada,” May 6 and 7 at the school. The Tahoe Truckee Regional Education Coalition is also planning a “Youth Symposium on Climate Change” for May 5 at the school. For more information, contact Jan Ellis, project director for Sierra Watershed Education Partnerships, jan@4swep.org. For details about the school and its environmental and energy programs, call Sue Mock, (530) 582-2751, ext. 3843.</description>

    <description>Segment 151 - In terms of lakes, Tahoe is a relatively harsh environment for fish. It was cutoff from other bodies of water many thousands of years ago, so as it evolved, only seven species of fish evolved in it. However, since the introduction of humans and human intervention at Lake Tahoe, that number has changed.  According to Brant Allen, fisheries biologist with the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center, “The original native game fish was the Lahontan cutthroat trout, which is no longer in the lake. But, there are still six native species of fish swimming in Tahoe.” The Lahontan cutthroat trout, named for the distinctive red streak under its chin, once topped Lake Tahoe’s food chain and weighed as much as 40 pounds. This fish thrived in the Tahoe Basin and migrated the length of the Truckee River between Tahoe and Pyramid Lake.  The native fish that still survive in Lake Tahoe include: • The mountain whitefish (Prosopium willaimsoni) is Lake Tahoe’s only native game fish. It lives near the bottom to a depth of about 100 feet.  • The Lahontan redside shiner (Richardsonius egregious) is a native minnow that is abundant in the shallow shorezone and can usually be seen in large numbers around marinas and rock crib piers. It grows to 3 to 4 inches long.  • The Lahontan speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus) is another native minnow that grows to about 2 to 3 inches long. It is difficult to find, as it seeks the cover of rocky substrate on the bottom of the lake.  • The tui chub (Gila bicolor) is a bottom-oriented chub that feeds on zooplankton or sediments on the bottom of the lake.  • The Tahoe sucker (Catostomus tahoensis) is a bottom feeder that grows to about 16 inches long.  • The Paiute sculpin (Cottus beldingi) grows to about 3 inches long. It lives under rocks and is rarely observed in less than 10 feet of water.  The native Lahontan cutthroat trout went extinct in Lake Tahoe in 1939, due in part to overfishing, competition with nonnative species, and the development of dams. In particular, Derby Dam below Reno and Sparks and the Tahoe Outlet Dam in Tahoe City isolated the Tahoe population of cutthroat trout from other populations within the historic range.  Beginning in the late 1800s, when the effects of human environmental changes had reduced the numbers of Lahontan cutthroat in the lake, humans began introducing nonnative fish species in hopes of increasing Tahoe’s yield of game fish. These introductions included lake trout from the Great Lakes, Chinook salmon, Atlantic salmon, golden trout, Arctic grayling, Great Lakes whitefish, brook trout, brown trout, and rainbow trout. Of these fish species, the lake trout, brown trout, brook trout, and rainbow trout were able to establish self-supporting populations in the Tahoe Basin. In the 20th century, additional introductions of nonnative invertebrates and fish further altered the Tahoe Basin ecosystem. Using the best available science at the time, exotic species were introduced with the intention of adding a recreational component or supporting an existing fishery. Unfortunately, not all of the species behaved as expected in the clear, cold waters of the Tahoe Basin.  After 70 years of alteration, the aquatic ecosystem now supports nonnative lake trout (Mackinaw) as the top predator. They are accompanied by rainbow trout, brown trout and kokanee salmon, providing multiple recreational fishing opportunities for shallow and deep-line anglers. The native Lahontan cutthroat trout is now among the most endangered western salmonids. Fortunately, as noted above, the other six native Tahoe fish species have survived the planned exotic introductions and continue to thrive within the Tahoe Basin.  In recent years, new threats to Tahoe’s remaining native fish have arisen. A number of warm-water fish species have been illegally introduced to Lake Tahoe, including largemouth and smallmouth bass, crappie, and sunfish. While these fish are typically associated with warm-water environments, their populations are able to grow and spread within the Tahoe Basin. Taking advantage of seasonally warm water in bays and marinas, the fish feed on native minnows and successfully spawn. Scientists from University of California Davis and University of Nevada Reno plan to study the potential expansion of these species, and with help from the USDA Forest Service Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, implement a plan for their control. “The warm-water invasive species appear to pose a great risk to Tahoe’s remaining native species,” states Brant Allen a research biologist for UC Davis. “Their ability to consume large numbers of fish and the apparent overlap with native minnow spawning areas is a big concern.”  Warm-water fish invasions are not new to California. Nearby Lake Davis continues to experience problems resulting from the illegal introduction of northern pike, a voracious predator. Controlling the spread of similar species in the Tahoe Basin could go a long way to preserving native fish and assist the recovery of Tahoe’s once great Lahontan cutthroat trout.</description>

    <description>Segement 152 - While bats are not the type of animal most people think of as cute and cuddly, they are an important part of Lake Tahoe’s ecosystem. However, due to decades of human fear and misunderstanding, bats are in alarming decline across the world. Not only are they suffering as their natural habitat is cleared for development, but humans also often exterminate them.  According to wildlife biologist Stewart McMorrow of the California Tahoe Conservancy, “People generally think that bats are dirty and that they may try to bite them. However, this could not be further from the truth. Bats keep themselves very tidy, and they are more afraid of humans than we are of them.”  In summer and fall, you will most likely see Tahoe’s bats feeding around sunset at the lake’s shores or near creeks. Bats choose special places to roost and sleep in the day, sometimes using standing dead trees or piers.  Bats are the only flying mammals. They give birth to live young and nourish them with milk. Being nocturnal, they are most active at night and sleep or roost during the day, hanging upside-down. They live in all types of habitats around the world, except at the poles.  Bats are more similar to humans than you would expect. They have a nine-month gestation period and usually only one baby per year. They have very complex bodies with bones very similar to humans. The supporting bones in their wings are like our fingers. Contrary to popular myths, bats are not blind, do not become entangled in human hair, and seldom transmit disease to other animals or humans.  All bats can see, but some use a special sonar system called echolocation. These bats make high-frequency calls out of their mouths or noses and then listen for echoes to bounce from objects in front of them. They are able to form pictures in their brains by listening to reflected sounds, just as we form pictures in our brains by interpreting reflected light with our eyes. In this way, bats are able to comfortably move around at night, avoiding predators, maneuvering around obstacles, locating their food, and capturing insects in total darkness.  Of the 5,000 species of mammals on the earth, over 900 are bats. In the Lake Tahoe Basin, there are about 13 species of bats. All of Tahoe’s bats eat insects and many small bats can eat hundreds of mosquitoes in a single hour. They need to eat so much because they have high metabolisms and expend a lot of energy in flight.  As consumers of vast amounts of pests, bats rank among humanity’s best allies. Depending on where you live, you may want to provide shelters, called bat boxes, for bats so they can help keep the mosquito population down. If we lose our bat species, the demand for chemical pesticides will increase, jeopardizing whole ecosystems of other animal and plant species.  The bats of Tahoe are largely migratory, arriving in the Tahoe area in early summer and staying until nights get cold enough to drive away their food sources. Then, they migrate to places warmer and richer in food for the winter. Occasionally, some bats may decide to spend  their winters inside our houses. They prefer stable areas where the temperature does not change significantly, such as in our attics.  When homeowners find that they have a family of bats in their attic or shed, they should seek professional advice from a wildlife biologist or agency, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Bats usually breed in the early summer, so they are most vulnerable during that time. Generally, a bat colony can be evicted when the babies are old enough to fly. A professional must make this decision with full cooperation from the landowner.  It is best to be gentle with these special animals in and around your home. Each species of bat holds a special niche in Lake Tahoe’s ecosystem. For more information about bats, bat houses, and related issues, see the Bat Conservation International Web site, http://www.batcon.org, or contact your local office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the California Department of Fish and Game, or the Nevada Division of Wildlife.</description>

    <description>Segment 153 - Sighting a bald eagle is a magnificent experience, especially after the bald eagle’s near extinction in the not-so-distant past. The bald eagle population fell to endangered levels of less than 500 pairs in the early 1960s due to hunting, habitat loss and contamination of waterways and food sources by various pollutants and pesticides, most notably DDT.  There was a similar drop in eagle populations at Lake Tahoe during the late 1980s, when the two nest sites in the basin were both inactive. There are usually only one or two pairs of bald eagles in the Tahoe Basin during the summer. However, during the winter, bald eagles migrate to Tahoe because it is more temperate than Alaska and Canada. According to wildlife biologist Stewart McMorrow, “as many as 20 eagles have been counted in the Tahoe Basin during the winter months.” Bald eagles live near large bodies of open water, such as lakes, marshes, seacoasts and rivers, where there are plenty of fish to eat and tall trees for nesting and roosting. Bald eagles feed primarily on fish, but also eat small animals, such as ducks, coots, muskrats, turtles, rabbits, and snakes. Occasionally, they also eat dead animals. They are a kind of predator called raptors. They swoop down to seize fish in their powerful, long and sharp talons. They exert approximately 1,000 pounds of pressure per square inch in each foot. They can carry their food off in flight, but can only lift about half their weight. Bald eagles can fly at speeds of about 65 miles per hour in level flight, and up to 150 or 200 miles per hour in a dive.  Bald eagles are monogamous and mate for life. A Bald eagle will only select another mate if its faithful companion dies. They build large nests, called eyries, at the top of sturdy, tall trees. The nests become larger as the eagles return to breed and add new nesting materials year after year. Bald eagles make their new nests an average of 2 feet deep and 5 feet wide. Eventually, some nests become 10 feet wide and weigh several tons. When a nest is destroyed by natural causes, it is often rebuilt nearby. Bald eagles line their nests with twigs, soft mosses, grasses and feathers.  The female lays one to three eggs each spring, which hatch after about 35 days of incubation. Feathers of newly hatched bald eaglets are light grey, and turn dark brown before they leave the nest in about 12 weeks. When they are 3 or 4 years old, bald eagles have mottled brown and white feathers under their wings and on their heads, tails and breasts. The distinctive white head and tail feathers do not appear until they are about 4 to 5 years old. Their beaks and eyes also turn from dark brown to yellow during this time.  Bald eagles are about 29 to 42 inches long, can weigh 7 to 15 pounds, and have a wingspan of 6 to 8 feet. This makes them one of the largest birds in North America. Females are larger than males, but both have white heads and tail feathers and yellow beaks.  The bald eagle is our national symbol, so when it became threatened with extinction in the 1960s, people took notice. Strong endangered species and environmental protection laws, as well as active private, state and federal conservation efforts, have brought back the bald eagle population from the edge of extinction in the United States. The use of DDT pesticide is now outlawed in the United States, which has contributed greatly to the return of the bald eagle to America's skies. There are now over 5,000 nesting pairs and 20,000 total birds in the lower 48 states. There are over 35,000 bald eagles in Alaska.  There are several other common raptors living at least part of the year in the Lake Tahoe Basin. One of the most common is the osprey, which is somewhat similar in appearance to the bald eagle, having white markings on its head and throat and a dark brown back and tail. It also preys mostly on fish. Most nests that you see in the Tahoe Basin are osprey nests. Sometimes eagles will steal freshly caught fish from the slightly smaller ospreys.  Forest hawks, which do not fish for food, include the sharp-shinned hawk, the Cooper’s hawk, and the northern goshawk. Such raptors are called accipiters. Other raptors in the Basin include the merlin, the great horned owl, the western screech owl, the flammulated owl, the northern Pigmy owl, the northern Saw-whet owl, and the rare California spotted owl. Red tail hawks also frequent Tahoe, and peregrine falcons sometimes pass through the region.

    <description>Segment 154 - After three years of weekly news segments on Tuesday evenings on Reno’s KOLO –TV News Channel 8, the Lake Tahoe Report is going off the air this week. Hosted by reporter Shelly Purdy, the 90-second segments have delivered on-the-spot coverage of a multitude of Tahoe’s environmental issues through interviews with interesting people involved in these issues in the Lake Tahoe community.  The weekly TV news segments have been complemented by these articles, printed weekly in Lake Tahoe newspapers. Each of the 154 articles covered the same topic that KOLO-TV news presented that week, but in more detail. The news department at KOLO-TV has provided tremendous support for the Lake Tahoe Report, including the airtime, a cameraman, and editing of each segment. The video segments and newspaper articles are archived and available on two Web sites. You can go to http://www.lteec.org, click on “In the News,” for a list of the article titles, and then click on the article you wish to view.  You can also go to http://www.tahoe.unr.edu to view the videos or the articles. From the home page, click on “digital collections,” then on “streaming video,” and finally on “complete list of videos.” The articles are under “related items.” Topics include water quality, natural history, ecology, wildfire prevention, place-based education in schools, and how residents can help protect the Lake Tahoe ecosystem.  Coauthor Heather Segale and I are interested in hearing your impressions of the articles and the TV news segments. Which topics have been most interesting? Have the Lake Tahoe Reports increased your knowledge of the Tahoe environment and its problems? Have they encouraged you to take any action to improve environmental conditions?  One or two Lake Tahoe Reports a month will continue to appear in Tahoe newspapers. We welcome your suggestions for new topics. Articles on important topics will also be combined and published as university publications. In addition, they will be used as part of the Docent Training program that we will be starting in 2006 for the new Thomas J. Long Foundation Education Center in the Tahoe Environmental Science Center on the Campus of Sierra Nevada College in Incline Village.  Coauthor Heather Segale and I would like to thank Jack Bowe, news director of KOLO-TV News Channel 8, for providing such wonderful support for this educational TV series. We also want to thank Tim Ill for his many trips to Tahoe in all kinds of weather to film over 150 interviews, often on icy stream banks or remote locations.  The sparkle and interest evident in all the TV segments is due in large part to the creativity and lively personality of TV host, Shelly Purdy. The Lake Tahoe Report would not have been possible without her knowledge of environmental issues and her expertise in interviewing all kinds of people on camera, and we thank her. Shelly will be taking a short break from her work to have a baby this spring.  We also want to thank the members of our advisory committee, including Leo Poppoff, Rex Norman, Julie Regan, Bob Richards, and John Reuter, for their topic suggestions and valuable information that helped make each article and TV news segment complete and accurate.  We greatly appreciate the grant funding which paid for production of the TV segments. This assistance was provided by the USDA Forest Service, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California State Water Resources Control Board, Lahontan Region, and the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.  Finally, I would like to personally thank my coauthor of these articles, Heather Segale, who initially proposed that we try to get the Lake Tahoe Report on television newscasts. Heather made her dream a reality. She coordinated the advisory committee, collected story topics, found experts to interview, and helped research and write the articles. Heather, now with the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center, is a leader in innovative educational programs in the Tahoe Basin.  I look forward to providing you with more information on Tahoe’s very special environment in the near future and welcome your comments and suggestions.
